joyOfGivingToGPGI=0.00001; % This is a purely technical trick for tie-breaking. In the payoffs at the end we will add this tiny value for every dollar given by each country. This will imply that if a player is indifferent between giving only to GPGIs or giving also to HPMFs, he will give only to GPGIs. This allows us to avoid creating articifical (non-credible) participation incentives from the fact that players give to PMFs supporting some GPGI with no direct contributions even though they will stop doing so as soon as there are direct contributions reaching that GPGI. The 'L' at the end of the function name signifies a 'larger' action space.
