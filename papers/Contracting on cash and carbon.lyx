\begin_layout Title
Contracting on Cash and Carbon: mechanisms to reward countries for reducing
 emissions and paying out universal cash transfers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Lennart Stern, Paris School of Economics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Part*

\emph on
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout the article we take the example of tropical forest conservation,
 in section (ref) we discuss how the proposals and result can be adapted
 to Carbon Pricing Reward funds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
to do: try to find indirect implementations of optimal mechanism with menu
 of options
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Various types of international mechanisms to reduce tropical deforestation
 already exist and further types have been proposed.
 The principal in each of these mechanisms is either a donor country (e.g.
 Norway) or an international institution (e.g.
 the Forest Carbon Partnership).
 In this article we will study how such mechanisms can best contribute to
 global welfare (in the models global welfare will be a weighted sum of
 the reduction in deforestation and the aggregate welfare of the people
 in the jurisdictions with tropical forests).
 It is for our purposes not important whether the principal is a donor country
 or an international institution.
 We will simply refer to `the principal' throughout the article.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important design choice is whether to contract with governments or with
 private actors such as companies or individuals.
 The models developed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "emph{https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2957896}"
target "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2957896"

\end_inset

, suggest that it might be more effective to contract with governments.
 In this article we restrict our attention to mechanisms contracting with
 governments.
 These governments can be at any level (national, state, local, municipal
 (see Cortez et al.
 2010) etc.).
 In the terminology of the UN REDD+ system, such mechanisms are known as
 `jurisdictional approaches'.
 Amongst jurisdictional approaches the question arises as to whether the
 principal should best contract with central or local governments (see Harstad
 2017 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "emph{https://www.sv.uio.no/econ/personer/vit/bardh/dokumenter/cc.pdf}"
target "https://www.sv.uio.no/econ/personer/vit/bardh/dokumenter/cc.pdf"

\end_inset

).
 It seems plausible that to the extent that the arguments that we will give
 are relevant, they weigh in favor of contracting with local governments.
 However, we will leave for future work a formal analysis of this question
 and will throughout this article take the level of governments with which
 to contract as given.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another important design choice (Chirouleu-Assouline et al.
 2017 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "emph{https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01643656/document}"
target "https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01643656/document"

\end_inset

) is whether to contract on deforestation policies (as for example the Forest
 Carbon Partnership's Carbon Fund does) or on results (as Norway does with
 Guyana, the Brazilian state of Acre and Indonesia) or on both deforestation
 policies and deforestation results simultaneously (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "emph{https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3086299}"
target "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3086299"

\end_inset

for an attempt to model the analogous problem that arises for an international
 institution that contracts by conditioning its reward payments jointly
 on renewable subsidies (the policies) and the renewable energy produced
 (the result)).
 Throughout this article we will assume that the principal contracts exclusively
 on results.
 The results can also be applied to the case where the principal contracts
 exclusively on policies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A further design choice is whether to tailor contracts to each agent (which
 we will call a `non-anonymous mechanism') or to propose a menu of contracts
 to the set of all jurisdictions with tropical forests, who can then chose
 their preferred option from the menu of contracts (which we will call an
 `anonymous mechanism').
 In this article we will apply the models that we will develop to both of
 these kinds of mechanism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To our knowledge, all existing international mechanisms to reduce tropical
 deforestation are non-anonymous.
 However, this is not to say that anonymous mechanisms might not be implemented
 in the future.
 Indeed, anonymous mechanisms already exist in at least one other realm
 of international cooperation: the World Bank's International Development
 Association allocates aid to developing countries based on a mathematical
 formula (
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "emph{https://siteresources.worldbank.org/IDA/Resources/Seminar%20PDFs/73449-1271341193277/PBAIDA16.pdf}"
target "https://siteresources.worldbank.org/IDA/Resources/Seminar%20PDFs/73449-1271341193277/PBAIDA16.pdf"

\end_inset

).
 One rationale for this is to solve the Samaritan's dilemma (
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "emph{https://edi.opml.co.uk/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/EDI-PF-PAPER-10-Bourguignon-and-Gunning.pdf}"
target "https://edi.opml.co.uk/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/EDI-PF-PAPER-10-Bourguignon-and-Gunning.pdf"

\end_inset

) by making it more credible that the principal implements the mechanism
 as announced.
 This credibility rationale seems also relevant to the mechanisms we will
 consider in this article.
 A further motivation for studying anonymous mechanisms in our context is
 given in (
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "emph{https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2967170}"
target "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2967170"

\end_inset

), where a treaty is proposed that could build on the existing CORSIA agreement
 to create a mechanism for financing several international institutions,
 including one contracting anonymously on reductions in deforestation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout this article we can interpret the results for both non-anonymous
 and anonymous mechanisms.
 Before introducing the question that this article will address, it is helpful
 to consider an existing non-anonymous mechanism, namely Norway's current
 contract with Guyana (Busch, Birdsall 2014).
 It is illustrated in the following graph:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename C:/Users/DELL/OneDrive/Documents/norway guyana current.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus Norway pays at a fixed rate per avoided deforestation (measured in
 avoided CO2 emissions) relative to a pre-established reference level, until
 some upper bound of payments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It has been suggested (Busch, Birdsall 2014 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "emph{https://www.cgdev.org/publication/assessing-performance-based-payments-forest-conservation-six-successes-four-worries-and}"
target "https://www.cgdev.org/publication/assessing-performance-based-payments-forest-conservation-six-successes-four-worries-and"

\end_inset

) that Norway could add a clause to the contract that would oblige the governmen
t of Guyana to pay out as a universal uniform cash transfer to its entire
 population at least a certain fraction of the money that it receives from
 Norway.
 Such a contract is illustrated in the graph below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename C:/Users/DELL/OneDrive/Documents/norway guyana proposed.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The question arises as to whether anything can be gained from this kind
 of contract as compared to two separate contracts, one rewarding Guyana
 as a function of its achieved reduction in deforestation and the other
 rewarding it as a function of the universal cash transfers that it pays
 out to its population.
 More precisely: Suppose we initially have a fixed budget with which we
 optimally contract on deforestation reduction and another fixed budget
 with which we optimally contract on universal cash transfers.
 Suppose now we pool the two budgets and simultaneously contract on both
 deforestation reduction and universal cash transfers.
 Would it be possible to achieve more on both dimensions (forest conservation
 and poverty reduction) by contracting simultaneously on the two variables?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before returning to this question, we note that cash transfers are widely
 considered to be an effective measure to alleviate poverty (
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "emph{https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/cash-transfers}"
target "https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/cash-transfers"

\end_inset

).
 Making the cash transfers universal has the advantage of eliminating targeting
 errors, which are large in many existing targeted transfer systems (For
 example, in India's targeted food subsidy system (called PDS) only 28%
 of transfers reach the 40% poorest people).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, universality reduces the potential for the system to be used for
 political patronage.
 Advances in biometric identification technology and in mobile phone technology
 for transferring money have lowered the cost of introducing a system for
 universal cash transfers.
 (Moss et al.
 2015).
 Aid agencies such as the UK Department for International Development have
 provided financial assistance to targeted cash transfer programs in poor
 countries (
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "emph{https://icai.independent.gov.uk/html-report/effects-dfids-cash-transfer-programmes-poverty-vulnerability/}"
target "https://icai.independent.gov.uk/html-report/effects-dfids-cash-transfer-programmes-poverty-vulnerability/"

\end_inset

).
 These activities can be interpreted as an instance of the aid agency contractin
g with developing country governments on targeted cash transfers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now concerning our question about whether anything can be gained from contractin
g jointly on deforestation reduction and universal cash transfers, let us
 first consider what we shall call `first best rationales'.
 Suppose that Norway is uncertain about whether the government of Guyana
 is benevolent towards its population or not.
 Suppose that if the government is benevolent towards its population then
 it will value highly the universal cash transfers paid out to its population
 (i.e.
 receiving reward payments that it has to pay out to its population in the
 form of universal cash transfers is almost as valuable to the government
 as receiving money with no further strings attached).
 Moreover, suppose that any reduction in deforestation that it might achieve
 will always be done in a way that benefits its population (e.g.
 through payments for ecosystem services schemes, PES, see Seema Jayachandran
 2017).
 However, suppose that if the government is not benevolent towards its populatio
n then it will hardly value at all the universal cash transfers paid out
 to its population.
 Moreover, suppose that any reduction in deforestation that it might achieve
 will always be done in a way that adversely affects its population (e.g.
 by forcefully evicting local populations and completely blocking access
 to forests 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "emph{http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/infobrief/6630-infobrief.pdf}"
target "http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/infobrief/6630-infobrief.pdf"

\end_inset

).
 Then if the principal (i.e.
 Norway in our example) could observe the types of the agents (i.e.
 the governments), it might be optimal to only make the government reduce
 deforestation if it is benevolent towards its population or at least to
 make the non-benevolent government reduce its deforestation by less than
 the benevolent government.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, more realistically, the agents' types are their private information.
 However, even then the principal can move closer to the first best allocation
 by contracting jointly on deforestation reduction and universal cash transfers.
 Indeed, there exist contracts of the form illustrated in figure 3 through
 which the government of Guyana will only participate in case it is benevolent
 towards it population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This first-best rationale is even more striking if we switch from the interpreta
tion of the mechanism as a non-anonymous one to an anonymous one, as illustrated
 in the following diagram:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename C:/Users/DELL/OneDrive/Documents/anonymous combined mechanism.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here again the contracts depicted allow the principal to induce the more
 benevolent governments to reduce their deforestation by more, which could,
 if the first-best rationale is valid, increase global welfare (relative
 to the situation where the principal contracts separately on the deforestation
 reduction and the universal cash transfers).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are views expressed in the literature that would imply that the first
 best rationale is an important consideration (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "emph{http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/infobrief/6630-infobrief.pdf}"
target "http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/infobrief/6630-infobrief.pdf"

\end_inset

).
 In fact, concerns about potential adverse effects on local populations
 from policies to reduce deforestation have led several influential NGOs
 to oppose the REDD-mechanisms entirely (
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "emph{http://wrm.org.uy/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/REDD-A-Collection-of-Conflict_Contradictions_Lies_expanded.pdf}"
target "http://wrm.org.uy/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/REDD-A-Collection-of-Conflict_Contradictions_Lies_expanded.pdf"

\end_inset

) However, others have argued that these concerns are mostly based on problems
 in past REDD projects that contracted with private entrepreneurs or companies
 and that future jurisdictional REDD contracts would avoid such problems
 (

 see also Busch, Seymour 2016).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have already argued above that if one beliefs that there are risks of
 adverse effects on local populations from policies to reduce deforestation
 then this would provide what we have called a first-best rationale for
 jointly contracting on deforestation reduction and universal cash transfers.
 Now let us explore the consequences of a different view.
 Specifically, let us make the limiting assumption that the impact of deforestat
ion reduction on the population's welfare is independent of the government's
 enthusiasm for universal cash transfers.
 In this case the first best rationale for jointly contracting on deforestation
 reduction and universal cash transfers disappears.
 The question arises as to whether there is still something to be gained
 from contracting with the governments on the two variables simultaneously,
 given that the governments' types are private information.
 In other words: Is there a `second-best rationale' for contracting jointly
 on deforestation reduction and universal cash transfers? To put it again
 more precisely: For fixed budgets, would it be possible to achieve more
 on both dimensions (forest conservation and population welfare) by contracting
 simultaneously on the two variables? We will find that under plausible
 conditions the answer is yes.
 Moreover, within the models that we will develop we will be able to give
 some properties that must hold at the optimal mechanism.

 The type-compementarity property means in this context the following: Consider
 two governments with payoffs that are identical in terms of their costs
 of reducing deforestation.
 Then at the optimal mechanism the one that is more enthusiastic about universal
 cash transfers paid out to its population will reduce deforestation by
 at least as much as the other.
 Secondly, for any two agents (i.e.
 governments) that are identical in terms of their costs of reducing deforestati
on, the one that has a lower cost associated with reducing deforestation
 will pay out at least as high universal cash transfers as the other.

\begin_layout Proposition
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "prop 1 Under-conditions-detailed"

\end_inset

Under conditions detailed in this article, the type-complementarity property
 must hold at the optimal mechanism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the model from Armstrong and Rochet (1999) the type-complementarity property
 holds.
 In fact this result is a direct corollary of their complete characterization
 of the optimal mechanism.
 The main contribution of the model that we will develop in section 1 is
 that it extends the model from Armstrong and Rochet by allowing us to take
 into account that the impact on population welfare of money spent by a
 government depends on the type of government.
 It is plausible that governments that value highly universal cash transfers
 reaching their population are typically more benevolent and will therefore
 spend marginal money in a way that is more beneficial to their population.
 Indeed, in the literature on foreign aid (see Deaton 2013) it has been
 argued that increasing the money at the free disposal of non-benevolent
 governments even has a negative effect on the expected population welfare
 by consolidating these regimes.
 We will see that taking this into account reinforces the second-best rationale
 for jointly contracting on deforestation reduction and universal cash transfers.
 Moreover, the type-complementarity property will still always hold at the
 optimal mechanism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "prop 2Suppose-that-governments'"

\end_inset

Suppose that governments' preferences are quasilinear in money.
 For the bounded linear contract with an obligation to pay out a percentage
 of the payments received as universal cash transfers, illustrated in diagram
 2, the type-complementarity property holds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{A}$
\end_inset

 denote the amount of deforestation reduction and let 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{B}$
\end_inset

 denote the amount of universal cash transfer paid out to the population.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $t(x^{A}$
\end_inset

) denote the reward payment that the government receives for its own budget
 if it reduces deforestation by 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{A}$
\end_inset

 and let 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{B}(t(x^{A}))$
\end_inset

 denote the amount of universal cash transfers that end up being paid to
 its population.
 We can write the government's payoff as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u(x^{A})=v(x^{A},x^{B}(t(x^{A})))+t(x^{A})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{du}{dx^{A}}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial x^{A}}+\frac{\partial v}{\partial x^{B}}\frac{dx^{B}}{dt}\frac{dt}{dx^{A}}+\frac{dt}{dx^{A}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial v}{\partial x^{A}}=\frac{\partial\tilde{v}}{\partial x^{A}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial v}{\partial x^{B}}\geq\frac{\partial\tilde{v}}{\partial x^{B}}\ \forall x^{A},x^{B}$
\end_inset

.
 Denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $(\tilde{x}^{A},\tilde{x}^{B})$
\end_inset

 the optimal choice for the type 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{v}$
\end_inset

.
 We compute:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{du}{dx^{A}}_{x^{A}=\tilde{x}^{A}}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial x^{A}}_{x^{A}=\tilde{x}^{A}}+\frac{\partial v}{\partial x^{B}}_{x^{A}=\tilde{x}^{A}}\frac{dx^{B}}{dt}_{x^{A}=\tilde{x}^{A}}\frac{dt}{dx^{A}}_{x^{A}=\tilde{x}^{A}}+\frac{dt}{dx^{A}}_{x^{A}=\tilde{x}^{A}}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since by assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{x}^{A}$
\end_inset

 is an interior solution for the type 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{v}$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{d\tilde{u}}{dx^{A}}_{x^{A}=\tilde{x}^{A}}=0$
\end_inset

, so that we obtain:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{du}{dx^{A}}_{x^{A}=\tilde{x}^{A}}-\frac{d\tilde{u}}{dx^{A}}_{x^{A}=\tilde{x}^{A}}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial x^{B}}_{x^{A}=\tilde{x}^{A}}\frac{dx^{B}}{dt}_{x^{A}=\tilde{x}^{A}}\frac{dt}{dx^{A}}_{x^{A}=\tilde{x}^{A}}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
which is nonnegative, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial v}{\partial x^{B}}\geq\frac{\partial\tilde{v}}{\partial x^{B}}$
\end_inset

 by assumption.
 Hence we deduce that 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{A}\geq\tilde{x}^{A}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{A}$
\end_inset

denotes the optimal choice given 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 The other part of the type-complementarity property follows by a similar
 argument.

 suggest that introducing the requirement to pay out a fixed percentage
 of the reward payments received as a universal cash transfer might be a
 way to move the allocation closer to the optimal one and thereby increase
 efficiency.
 In a soon to be finished version of this article this question will be
 explored in some numerical examples.

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, our results suggest that under plausible conditions there is a
 second-best rationale for contracting jointly on deforestation reductions
 and universal cash transfers.
 As we saw, there might also be a first best rationale.
 Our results suggest that if one starts with separate mechanisms contracting
 only on deforestation reduction and only on universal cash transfers, respectiv
ely, then better outcomes in both dimensions, i.e.
 in deforestation reduction and in the population welfare in the corresponding
 jurisdictions can be achieved by adding a clause to the deforestation reduction
 mechanism that would require the government to pay out a certain fraction
 of the reward payments that it receives as universal cash transfers.

\emph on
An extension to the 2 by 2 types model from Armstrong and Rochet (1999)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will now study a fairly general model of a principal contracting with
 a set of agents on 2 variables.
 It extends the model of Armstrong and Rochet (1999) to allow us to take
 into account that different types of agents will generate different contributio
ns to welfare from the spending that they undertake using their available
 money.
 In our application this is potentially important: The international institution
 (the principal) should be less concerned about leaving rents to governments
 (the agents) that are benevolent towards their population and therefore
 will spend their available money relatively well than about leaving rents
 to governments that are less benevolent towards their population and therefore
 will spend their available money relatively less well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will later on assume that the international institution has an exogenous
 budget.
 However, to prepare the ground, we will first establish results assuming
 that the cost of funds for the international institution is exogenous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The type space is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ L,H\right\} \times\{L,H\}$
\end_inset

.
 The first component of the type describes the `deforestation type' and
 the second component the `universal cash transfer type'.
 In our application the superscript 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 refers to deforestation and the superscript 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 refers to cash transfers.
 If the type 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{ij}$
\end_inset

 reduces deforestation by 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{A}$
\end_inset

, pays out a universal cash transfer of 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{B}$
\end_inset

 to its population and receives the payment 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, then his payoff is:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

 net cost that the government incurs from reducing its deforestation by

 In other words, it could be different from the monetary cost of reducing
 deforestation for the government.
 The monetary cost for the government arises from foregone revenues from
 forest concessions, from expenditure on law enforcement, etc..
 The subjective cost might also be affected by political considerations.
 In fact, the results that we will obtain can be generalized to a model
 with the general interpretation of 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}^{A}\left(x^{A}\right)$
\end_inset

 being the subjective cost that the government faces.
 However, for ease of exposition we shall from now on assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}^{A}\left(x^{A}\right)$

 is the pure monetary cost arising from reducing deforestation for the governmen

 its population's welfare relatively little or that values only the welfare

Let us denote by

 Let us denote by

 the amount by which the government would reduce deforestation in the absence

 might be more concerned about its population's welfare and thus generates
 more welfare increases per dollar of additional spending.

The principal's objective is a weighted sum of the reduction in deforestation

Comparing our model with that of Armstrong and Rochet (1999) we note that

 capturing the effect of the money at the disposal of the different agents

We obtain the identity

Let us denote by

 The payment that the agent receives from the principal can be decomposed

 In the case of a principal contracting with a single government (Such as

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\text{ij}}$

 In the case of an international institution defining an anonymous mechanism

\emph on
Interpretation: This assumption means that the two types are unambiguously
 ordered in terms of costs of reducing deforestation and that the difference

 In general this can be interpreted as a measure of how enthusiastic the

\begin_inset space ~

: It is plausible that the more benevolent governments use money in a way

 As far as the `ease of reducing deforestation' dimension is concerned,
 it is not clear how this dimension would be correlated with the benefits
 of additional government spending for the population welfare.
 It is therefore natural to assume that these two questions are independent,
 as we do here.

 increase welfare through some perturbations that increase

 is necessary for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{A,B}^{*}=\mathcal{M}_{A}^{*}\oplus\mathcal{M}_{B}^{*}$

 Indeed, the IC constraint requiring that HH not have an incentive to pretend

 Both the informational rent accruing to LL and the informational rent accruing

The problem of computing

\end_inset

 that is to accrue to the type 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{HH}$
\end_inset

 and in the second step one can choose the values of the contracting variables
 under that constraint.
 Let us denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{1},\eta_{2},\eta_{3}$

 the Lagrange multipliers corresponding respectively to the constraints

In the first step one must choose

 optimally, anticipating that one will choose optimally in the second step.
 This requirement is equivalent to the value of increasing

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\text{HH}}(b_{\text{HH}}-\lambda)$

 This means that 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{1}+\eta_{2}+\eta_{3}=\alpha_{\text{HH}}(b_{\text{HH}}-\lambda)$

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose we choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda,z$
\end_inset

 such that the expected outcome in both dimensions 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is the same as under the optimal separate mechanisms with budgets 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{B}$
\end_inset

.
 Then we know from proposition 1 that if 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho<\frac{\alpha_{\text{HL}}\alpha_{\text{LH}}}{\alpha_{\text{LL}}}+\frac{b_{H}-b_{L}}{\lambda-b_{H}}\frac{\alpha_{\text{HL}}\alpha_{\text{LH}}}{\alpha_{\text{LH}}+\alpha_{\text{LL}}}\left(1-\alpha_{\text{HH}}+\frac{\alpha_{\text{HL}}\alpha_{\text{LH}}}{\alpha_{\text{LL}}}\right)$
\end_inset

 we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $M<M^{A}+M^{B}$
\end_inset

.
 But if 
\begin_inset Formula $M<M^{A}+M^{B}$
\end_inset

 then there is free money that can be spent to achieve that the outcomes
 in both dimensions are improved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conversely, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\geq\frac{\alpha_{\text{HL}}\alpha_{\text{LH}}}{\alpha_{\text{LL}}}+\frac{b_{H}-b_{L}}{\lambda-b_{H}}\frac{\alpha_{\text{HL}}\alpha_{\text{LH}}}{\alpha_{\text{LH}}+\alpha_{\text{LL}}}\left(1-\alpha_{\text{HH}}+\frac{\alpha_{\text{HL}}\alpha_{\text{LH}}}{\alpha_{\text{LL}}}\right)$
\end_inset

 then by proposition 1 we cannot achieve the same results with less money,
 which is equivalent to saying that we cannot achieve better outcomes in
 both dimensions with the same amount of money.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\square$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Armstrong and Rochet (1999) obtained the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\geq\frac{\alpha_{\text{HL}}\alpha_{\text{LH}}}{\alpha_{\text{LL}}}$
\end_inset

, which is necessary and sufficient for there to be nothing to be gained
 from simultaneously contracting on the two variables.
 Corollary 1 shows that taking into account the fact that governments more
 enthusiastic about cash transfers will in expectation also spend marginal
 money in a more beneficial way leads to a strengthening of the case for
 contracting simultaneously on the two variables, at least in the following
 sense: taking into account this consideration leads to a shrinking in the
 set of parameter values such that nothing is gained by contracting simultaneous
ly on both variables.
 To see why this is so, it is sufficient to check that the term 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{b_{H}-b_{L}}{\lambda-b_{H}}\frac{\alpha_{\text{HL}}\alpha_{\text{LH}}}{\alpha_{\text{LH}}+\alpha_{\text{LL}}}\left(1-\alpha_{\text{HH}}+\frac{\alpha_{\text{HL}}\alpha_{\text{LH}}}{\alpha_{\text{LL}}}\right)$
\end_inset

 is positive.
 By assumption 2 we know that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda-b_{H}>0$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover, since all the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\text{ij}}$
\end_inset

 are probabilities, both 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\alpha_{\text{HL}}\alpha_{\text{LH}}}{\alpha_{\text{LH}}+\alpha_{\text{LL}}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1-\alpha_{\text{HH}}+\frac{\alpha_{\text{HL}}\alpha_{\text{LH}}}{\alpha_{\text{LL}}}\right)$
\end_inset

 are positive.
 Hence the larger 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{H}-b_{L}$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 the larger the difference in the effect of spending by the more benevolent
 and the less benevolent governments), the smaller (in the sense of set
 inclusion) the set of distributions of types such that nothing is gained
 by contracting simultaneously on both variables.

 In solving the first best problem one considers 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\text{ij}}^{A}\left(x_{\text{ij}}^{A}\right)$
\end_inset

 and the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\text{ij}}^{A}$

 affects the transfer 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\text{ij}}$
\end_inset

 that one has to pay in order to satisfy the participation constraint of
 the agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{ij}$
\end_inset

 This is similar to the situation in the second best problem, where instead
 the minimal utility is determined by the informational rents implied by
 the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{k,l}^{A}$
\end_inset

 for the other types.
 The only difference is that in the second best problem 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\text{ij}}^{A}$
\end_inset

 can affect the informational rents that need to be left to the other types.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\text{ij}}^{A}$
\end_inset

 can cause an increase in informational rents only if there is an arrow
 coming somewhere from the east.
 Hence if there are no arrows arriving at

 coming somewhere from the east, then 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\text{ij}}^{A}\geq{x_{\text{ij}}^{A}}^{*}$

 In other words, we would have

 But by corollary 3 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\text{LL}}^{A}\leq{x_{\text{LL}}^{A}}^{*}$

 This is in contradiction to our assumption that

\begin_inset Formula $({\hat{x}}_{\text{LL}}^{A},{\hat{x}}_{\text{LH}}^{A},{\hat{x}}_{\text{HL}}^{A},{\hat{x}}_{\text{HH}}^{A},{\hat{x}}_{\text{LL}}^{B},{\hat{x}}_{\text{LH}}^{B},{\hat{x}}_{\text{HL}}^{B},{\hat{x}}_{\text{HH}}^{B},{\hat{t}}_{\text{LL}},{\hat{t}}_{\text{LH}},{\hat{t}}_{\text{HL}},{\hat{t}}_{\text{HH}})$
\end_inset

.
 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho<\frac{\alpha_{\text{HL}}\alpha_{\text{LH}}}{\alpha_{\text{LL}}}+\frac{b_{H}-b_{L}}{\lambda-b_{H}}\frac{\alpha_{\text{HL}}\alpha_{\text{LH}}}{\alpha_{\text{LH}}+\alpha_{\text{LL}}}\left(1-\alpha_{\text{HH}}+\frac{\alpha_{\text{HL}}\alpha_{\text{LH}}}{\alpha_{\text{LL}}}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Then we can deduce from proposition 1 that 
\begin_inset Formula $({\hat{x}}_{\text{LL}}^{A},{\hat{x}}_{\text{LH}}^{A},{\hat{x}}_{\text{HL}}^{A},{\hat{x}}_{\text{HH}}^{A},{\hat{x}}_{\text{LL}}^{B},{\hat{x}}_{\text{LH}}^{B},{\hat{x}}_{\text{HL}}^{B},{\hat{x}}_{\text{HH}}^{B})$
\end_inset

 can be implemented by having the international institution 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{B}$
\end_inset

 abandon its previous mechanism and instead offer a certain transfer 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{t}$
\end_inset

 conditional only on a government having paid out at least 
\begin_inset Formula ${\hat{x}}_{\text{LL}}^{B}$
\end_inset

 as a universal cash transfer and contributing the remaining money from
 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{B}$
\end_inset

 to the international institution 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{A}$
\end_inset

, which will use a mechanism corresponding to the following diagram:

Again, the optimal mechanism implemented in this way will have all four
 countries choose points at the kinks.
 The overall optimal mechanism is the sum of the mechanism depicted in the
 diagram and the aid agency's mechanism that consists of paying each government
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{t}$
\end_inset

 conditional on the government paying out at leas 
\begin_inset Formula ${\hat{x}}_{\text{LL}}^{B}$
\end_inset

 as universal cash transfers.
 Hence the values shown for the part of mechanism depicted in the diagram
 are related to the values of the overall optimal mechanism as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{\text{LL}}^{A}={\hat{x}}_{\text{LL}}^{A},x_{\text{LH}}^{A}={\hat{x}}_{\text{LH}}^{A},x_{\text{HL}}^{A}={\hat{x}}_{\text{HL}}^{A},x_{\text{HH}}^{A}={\hat{x}}_{\text{HH}}^{A},x_{\text{LL}}^{B}=0,x_{\text{LH}}^{B}={\hat{x}}_{\text{LH}}^{B}-{\hat{x}}_{\text{LL}}^{B},x_{\text{HL}}^{B}={\hat{x}}_{\text{HL}}^{B}-{\hat{x}}_{\text{LL}}^{B},x_{\text{HH}}^{B}={\hat{x}}_{\text{HH}}^{B}-{\hat{x}}_{\text{LL}}^{B},{t_{\text{LL}}=\hat{t}}_{\text{LL}}-\tilde{t},{t_{\text{LH}}=\hat{t}}_{\text{LH}}-\tilde{t},{t_{\text{HL}}=\hat{t}}_{\text{HL}}-\tilde{t},,{t_{\text{HH}}=\hat{t}}_{\text{HH}}-\tilde{t}
\]

\begin_layout Standard
In the particular example illustrated in the graph we have 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\text{HH}}^{A}=x_{\text{HL}}^{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\text{HH}}^{B}=x_{LH}^{B}$
\end_inset

.
 In the appendix we give in proposition 3.2 sufficient conditions for this
 property to hold at the optimal mechanism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above analysis illustrates the following opportunity: Suppose there
 is a mechanism contracting with governments only on reductions in deforestation.
 Suppose specifically, that there is an international institution defining
 an anonymous mechanism, implementing this for example through reward payment
 schedules as illustrated in figure 5.
 Suppose an aid agency is considering expanding its budget for contracting
 on cash transfers with governments in the countries with tropical forests.
 It could instead contribute the corresponding money to the international
 institution that hitherto only contracted on reductions in deforestation.
 The aid agency could require the international institution to modify its
 mechanism along the lines illustrated by the modification from figure 4
 to figure 5.
 What we have shown is that there exist such modifications such that a greater
 gain in aggregate population welfare is achieved whilst the reduction in
 deforestation is the same.
 Therefore, the aid agency has an opportunity to purchase greater welfare
 increases by engaging in this form of moral cooperation than it has if
 it were to only contract by itself.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a wide range of views on what effects an expansion of the REDD+
 mechanism would have on the welfare of people in the jurisdictions with
 tropical forests.
 Whilst many NGOs support an expansion of the REDD+ mechanism, opposition
 by other NOGs thinking that such an expansion would adversely affect the
 welfare of people in the jurisdictions with tropical forests has caused
 donor governments to not contribute the money that they had promised (Busch,
 Seymour, 2016).
 The NGOs all presumably pursue objectives that are some weighted sum of
 the reduction in deforestation and the welfare of people.
 They also presumably share the view that since donor countries are rich,
 increasing their contribution to at least some relatively unambiguous programs
 like funding universal cash transfers to people in poor countries will
 increase global welfare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Acknowledging that these empirical disagreements, the question arises as
 to what kind of mechanisms could use additional donor money in a way that
 unambiguously (i.e.
 under the various empirical views that the different NGOs hold) improves
 outcomes in both the main outcome dimensions, namely the welfare of people
 in jurisdictions with tropical forests and the reduction in aggregate deforesta
tion.
 One kind of mechanism that could achieve this is that of contracting on
 reductions in deforestation but requiring the governments receiving the
 reward payments to pay out a certain fraction of the money received as
 universal cash transfers to their populations.
 At the very least, this is a way of achieving compromise.
 Moreover, in this article we have provided results suggesting that there
 are also efficiency gains to be achieved from such joint contracting on
 the two variables.
 In the introduction we have provided a first best rationale for this, assuming
 that the pessimistic NGOs are correct.
 Moreover, we have shown that there is also a second best rationale for
 joint contracting that applies under plausible assumptions for all the
 views that the different NGOs hold.

Proposition 3.2:
\series default
 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula ${x_{\text{LH}}^{A}}^{*}\geq{x_{\text{LL}}^{A}}^{*},{x_{\text{HL}}^{A}}^{*}\geq{x_{\text{LL}}^{A}}^{*}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula ${{x_{\text{HH}}^{A}}^{*}\geq x_{\text{HL}}^{A}}^{*}$
\end_inset

 and also 
\begin_inset Formula ${x_{\text{HL}}^{B}}^{*}\geq{x_{\text{LL}}^{B}}^{*},{x_{\text{LH}}^{B}}^{*}\geq{x_{\text{LL}}^{B}}^{*}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula ${{x_{\text{HH}}^{B}}^{*}\geq x_{\text{LH}}^{B}}^{*}$
\end_inset

 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\text{HH}}^{A}=x_{\text{HL}}^{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\text{HH}}^{B}=x_{\text{LH}}^{B}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By proposition 3 we know that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\text{HH}}^{A}\geq x_{\text{HL}}^{A}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a contradiction, suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\text{HH}}^{A}>x_{\text{HL}}^{A}$
\end_inset

.
 Then there must be a black arrow arriving at HH from the left.
 Also, by LH, HH, HL we cannot have a black arrow from HH to HL.
 Hence we have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since there must be a path of black arrows from HH to LL, we must have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename C:/Users/DELL/Downloads/LHLLHH (12).png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From HH, HL, LL we deduce that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\text{HL}}^{B}<x_{\text{LL}}^{B}$
\end_inset

.
 But proposition 2 applied with A and B swapped tells us that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\text{HL}}^{B}\geq x_{\text{LL}}^{B}$
\end_inset

, a contradiction.
 We thus must have 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\text{HH}}^{A}=x_{\text{HL}}^{A}.$
\end_inset

 By symmetry we also deduce that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\text{HH}}^{B}=x_{\text{LH}}^{B}$
