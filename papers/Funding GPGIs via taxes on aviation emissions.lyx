\begin_layout Abstract
The EU is considering unilateral action to achieve higher carbon pricing
 for international aviation.
 It has been proposed that the EU could start a club mechanism whereby participa
ting countries would allocate a certain proportion of aviation carbon pricing
 revenue to some agreed-upon global institution for climate change mitigation.
 We propose an alternative club mechanism in which participating countries
 that give up the right to keep any of the carbon pricing revenue would
 be allowed to allocate this revenue to global public good institutions
 (GPGIs) of their choice.
 We consider an example where the set of GPGIs recognised as eligible includes
 2 GPGIs for global health as well as 4 for climate change mitigation.
 In the numerical simulations this alternative mechanism can achieve 13%
 more expected gains for global welfare than the one currently proposed.
 At the Nash equilibria most participating countries give up the right to
 retain any money so that they can affect the allocation of money in favor
 of the GPGIs that they prefer.
 We then enrich this mechanism by adding the possibility for countries to
 support a set of GPGIs by giving money to so-called Proportional Matching
 Funds, which then distribute it to the GPGIs in proportion to the allocations
 made to them by others.
 In the numerical simulations we find that this further enhances participation
 incentives and allows 29% more expected global welfare to be generated
 than the currently proposed mechanism.

\begin_layout Standard
Through the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation
 (CORSIA) the participating countries will oblige airlines to offset a part
 of their emissions by buying certificates for projects that have been certified
 to have reduced emission.
 CORSIA thus has the potential to improve global welfare in two ways: firstly,
 causing reductions in aviation emissions due to the carbon price that airlines
 will face.
 Secondly, through the money generated for the offset projects that will
 be financed through the sale of emissions reductions certificates to airlines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The offset eligibility standard under CORSIA is currently under negotiation.
 Depending on the standard chosen, different types of projects will get
 financed, such as REDD projects for reducing tropical deforestation or
 Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects for financing renewable energy
 projects in developing countries.
 A further dimension in which offset standards differ is their stringency.

 find that under some offset eligibility rules that have been proposed,
 demand from CORSIA would be met by projects that would continue anyway
 and the price for the offsets per ton of 
\begin_inset Formula $CO_{2}$
\end_inset

 would drop below $1.
 Based on this concern, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium, Austria,
 Finland and Norway have threatened independently to withdraw from the agreement
 if the offset eligibility standards are not chosen stringent enough.
 The EU is considering instituting further carbon pricing policies for internati
onal aviation in parallel to CORSIA.
 This study will compare 3 proposals for club mechanisms for taxing emissions
 from international aviation and raising money for Global Public Good Institutio
ns (GPGIs) that groups of countries such as the EU could initiate.
 By a GPGI we shall mean any institution that uses money to cause increases
 in the provision of a particular global public good.
 One example of a GPGI is a carbon offset standard like the one that will
 be chosen for CORSIA.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first proposal that we will define, named CORSIA+, is based on suggestions
 that were commonly made in response to a public consultation held by the
 EU on the question of which carbon pricing policies to pursue for international
 aviation.
 In CORSIA+, participating countries would be obliged to tax at an agreed-upon
 rate 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 all emissions from outgoing international flights as well as all emissions
 from flights coming in from non-participating countries.
 Each participating country would be allowed to retain for itself a proportion
 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 (called the retention rate parameter) of the tax revenue collected.
 The remaining part of the tax revenue would be allocated to an agreed-upon
 GPGI for climate change mitigation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We study the likely outcomes for different values of the retention rate
 parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 in a model that we also use to analyze the other mechanism that we propose.
 In the model the world is partitioned into the 12 regional blocks of countries
 of the RICE model 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "(Nordhaus 2010)"
target "https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/28461#"

\end_inset

, each of which is assumed to act as a unitary player maximizing the aggregate
 payoffs of the countries that it comprises.
 We focus on the case of a small tax rate 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 that CORSIA+ would oblige participants to impose on emissions from internationa
l flights and estimate the countries' payoffs for this case.
 The assumption of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 being small is made  to simplify the model, allowing us to make several
 linearity assumptions.
 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As we will argue in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Overall-comparison-of"

\end_inset

, the results about the comparative performance of the different mechanisms
 will plausibly hold for all 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 To estimate the payoffs in the game we use data and econometric estimates
 where possible, whilst resorting to several ad hoc assumptions where this
 appears necessary.
 We use an iterated best response algorithm that starts with a set of players
 that roughly correspond to the current participants in the CORSIA treaty.
 At each step of the algorithm a randomly selected player is given the opportuni
ty to adjust his strategy to play a best response to the other players'
 strategy profile at that step.
 For the mechanisms studied, the algorithm always terminates, meaning that
 we always reach a Nash equilibrium.
 For CORSIA+ we find that for 
\begin_inset Formula $r\leq0.35$
\end_inset

 we always reach a Nash equilibrium with no participation and for 
\begin_inset Formula $r\geq0.5$
\end_inset

 we always reach a Nash equilibrium with full participation, whilst for
 
\begin_inset Formula $r=0.4$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r=0.45$
\end_inset

 either of theses outcomes can occur, depending on the random realisations
 of the draws made in the iterated best response algorithm.
 The question arises as to whether we could modify CORSIA+ so as to enhance
 participation incentives in other ways than by increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 The alternative mechanisms that we will propose in this article are motivated
 by this question and answer it in the affirmative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first alternative proposal is called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Simple MGF Mechanism
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which stands for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In this mechanism participants would not be obliged to allocate money to
 a single fixed GPGI, as is the case in CORSIA and CORSIA+.
 Instead, there would be a set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 of GPGIs that would be recognized as being eligible for receiving money
 through the mechanisms.
 Participants would be given two options.
 The first is to participate 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

with the right to allocate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In this case the participant would have to allocate all the tax revenue
 collected to the GPGIs from 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 The second option is to participate 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

without the right to allocate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in which case the country could retain a proportion 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 of the tax revenue collected.
 The money not retained by those participating without right to allocate
 is given to the GPGIs in proportion to the allocations made to them by
 those who participate with right to allocate.
 Thereby the effective influence of those participating with right to allocate
 is enhanced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the numerical simulations we find that the Simple MGF mechanism can achieve
 13% more gains in expected welfare than CORSIA+.
 At the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 that maximises the expected welfare for the Simple MGF mechanism, 37% more
 money is raised for GPGIs than under CORSIA+ wtih the correponding value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 At the Nash equilibria reached under the Simple MGF Mechanism many players
 choose to participate with right to allocate, thus allocating all the tax
 revenue that they collect to GPGIs and retaining none of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To further enhance the incentives to participate with the right to allocate,
 we enrich the mechanism by allowing countries to give to so-called All-Encompas
sing Proportional Matching Funds (AEPMFs).
 For each subset 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 of size at least 2 of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 of eligible GPGIs, there would be a corresponding AEPMF.
 An AEPMF for a set 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 of GPGIs would each month distribute the money it has received during the
 month to the GPGIs in 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

, in proportion to the amounts that these GPGIs have received from all other
 sources (i.e.
 as direct allocations or from other AEPMFs) during that month.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the numerical simulations the MGF mechanism with AEPMFs performs best.
 At the value of retention rate parameter that maximises the expected welfare
 generated by the MGF with AEPMFs, 29% more welfare is generated and 47%
 more tax revenue is raised than under CORSIA+ for the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 that maximises expected welfare for the latter.

 Members in the club would be obliged to establish a carbon price of at
 least some agreed-upon level and to apply punitive ad-valorem tariffs on
 all goods that are imported from non-participating countries.
 Nordhaus emphasizes the risk that such a mechanism could pose to the world
 trading system.
 Non-participates might retaliate, which could possibly lead to a trade
 war.

It would therefore be valuable if mechanisms could be designed that would
 increase the incentives for global public good provision without resorting
 to punitive sanctions on non-participants.

 interaction between countries, transforming it into a three stage game
 where in the first stage countries decide whether to participate, in the
 second stage participants act jointly and in the third stage non-participants
 play a best response.
 The more countries participate, the greater the contributions decided in
 the second stage.
 As a result, participation incentives emerge.

 finds that the level of emissions abatement attainable through this is
 rather limited.
 One way to enhance incentives that he proposes is to use conditional matching
 offers, where countries would commit to abating more if the others abate
 more.
 If these matching offers are credible, then the incentives for each country
 to abate are enhanced because by doing so it will be able to cause others
 to abate more.

 notes that negotiating conditional offers are time-consuming and costly.
 Furthermore, he finds that a series of short-term commitment periods lead
 to a hold-up problem with under-investments in green technology.
 Based on this, he proposes that conditional pledges should be expressed
 according to pre-specified formulas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conditional matching for contributions on a single dimension (e.g.
 national emissions reduction) with pre-specified formulas has been studied,
 amongst others, by Guttman’s (1978, 1987),

, Rübbelke (2006) and Boadway et al.
 (2011) in a two stage game: Emissions abatement is divided into an unconditiona
l and a conditional abatement.
 Countries simultaneously declare matching factors, which define how much
 conditional abatement they will contribute for a unit of unconditional
 abatement contributed by each of the other countries.
 Assuming countries can commit to the matching factors they declare, this
 scheme allows countries to alter the incentives of other countries.

 rigorously prove the remarkable result that in the case of two countries
 there is a unique subgame perfect Nash equilibrium in this game and at
 this equilibrium efficient levels of abatement are reached.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One practical difficulty for the implementation of such conditional matching
 mechanisms is that abatement measures might be difficult to compare.
 Moreover, it might not be credible that countries will follow through on
 their commitments.
 This might necessitate using the threat of sanctions to make the commitments
 credible (
\begin_inset CommandInset href

\end_inset

)

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The use of sanctions for this seems a lot less problematic than applying
 punitive sanction to non-participants to an agreement.
 If sanctions are used to help countries to voluntarily commit to following
 through on matching offers, these sanctions might never actually be applied
 and yet be effective.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In contrast to this, in the MGF mechanisms that we will propose incentives
 to contribute money to GPGIs are created without any reliance on countries'
 ability to commit.
 On the other hand, the mechanisms that we propose are far less ambitious
 than the conditional matching mechanisms analyzed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href

target "https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7yc3g/"

\end_inset

.
 The amount of cooperation achieved is fundamentally limited by how much
 money is raised for GPGIs via the aviation emissions taxes.
 The mechanisms we propose could serve as a potential incremental opportunity
 to raise money for GPGIs and thereby complement other mechanisms for global
 public good provision.

 a point on the unit sphere in 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{n}$

\begin_inset Formula $n$

 The policy change implemented is a weighted sum of the reported preferred
 directions for change.
 This mechanism is first order strategy proof.
 It is closely related to quadratic voting, for which efficiency results

 In future work we intend to study the mechanism obtained by combining the
 MGF mechanism with the Normalised Gradient Addition mechanism instead of
 with All-Encompassing Proportional Matching Funds.
\end_layout

In this paper we only study a case where the overall money raised is small,
 so that the countries' payoffs are linear in the money reaching the different
 GPGIs.
 It will be interesting to see in future work how the MGF mechanism with
 All-Encompassing Proportional Matching Funds (AEPMFs) (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) will perform in a model where there are decreasing marginal returns to
 money going to the different GPGIs.
 An alternative mechanism with which the MGF mechanism could be combined
 (instead of with the AEPMFs) is the Liberal Radicalism Mechanism that was

This is assuming, as is common in the literature (such as on the VCG mechanism),
 that each agent can neglect the cost of public funds.

 In their analysis it is assumed that the government can raise any tax revenue
 required for the donation matching.
 This assumption, whilst valid for the context of public goods within a
 country, no longer holds for global public goods, given the absence of
 a world government.
 The starting point of the current paper is that global public goods are
 all underprovided and that the mechanisms studied will not achieve anything
 near an efficient level of global public good provision.
 From this it follows that there are two opportunities to increase global
 welfare: rasing more money for GPGIs and improving the allocative efficiency
 of the distribution across the different GPGIs of whatever money is raised.

 suggest that grafting this mechanism onto the MGF mechanism will plausibly
 lead to higher allocative efficiency than the MGF mechanism with AEPMFs.
 However, the MGF mechanism with AEPMFs might raise more money for GPGIs.
 Future research could study the relative overall performance of these mechanism
s.

 Trading Scheme (ETS) (measure taken in 2012 and suspended in 2013)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 2012 the EU extended its emissions trading scheme to include aviation.
 Airlines have been receiving annual tradable allowances covering a certain
 level of emissions.
 Any shortfall between the allocated sum of free emissions allowances and
 their actual emissions require the purchase of additional allowances.
 Initially, all flights arriving in or departing from an airport in the
 EU were included.
 The 'equivalent measures policy' set out in the

\end_inset

 promised that whenever 'a third country adopts measures, which have an
 environmental effect at least equivalent to that of this Directive', flights
 from that country arriving in the EU would be exempted from obligations
 to be covered with emission permits.
 The directive stated that 'the Community scheme may serve as a model' and
 that member states should 'encourage third countries to take equivalent
 measures'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, states such as the US, China, India, Russia and Saudi Arabia opposed
 the scheme and partly prohibited their airlines from complying with it

\end_inset

).
 In response to this opposition, the EU modified after only one year (in
 November 2012) the system to a ‘reduced scope’, which means that only flights
 between and within EU member states are included.
 This ‘stop-the-clock’ approach is temporary and if no new decision is made,
 ‘full scope’ will start again in 2024

 Even once an offset category has been accepted, there remain crucial choices
 about vintage conditions.

 to new projects or projects that are at risk of discontinuing greenhouse
 gas abatement without further support.
 Without such a restriction, they conclude, the offset demand from CORSIA
 would be met by projects that would continue anyway and the price for the
 offsets per ton of CO2 would drop below $1.
 Fearing that the standards that end up being chosen will be very lax and,
 France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium, Austria, Finland and Norway
 have threatened independently to withdraw from the agreement if the offset
 eligibility standards are not chosen stringent enough.

Based on these concerns of a dilution of the level of ambition of CORSIA,
 the EU has kept open the possibility of taking unilateral measures to increase
 carbon pricing on international aviation.
 As mentioned in

reference "subsec:The-EU's-unilateral"

\end_inset

, by default, all flights to and from EU countries will again be included
 in the EU emissions trading scheme in 2024.
 The EU appears to also be open to alternative mechanisms, as it held a
 public consultation in 2016 on the question.
 In the next section we will build on suggestions made in response to this
 consultation.
 Based on the suggestion we will define a proposal for a club mechanism
 for taxing international aviation emissions and financing a global public
 good institution for climate change mitigation.

 In response to this consultation a common suggestion was that the EU should
 price carbon emissions from all flights, either by reinstating the ETS
 with full scope and with 'equivalent measures policies' as it did in 2012
 (see section

 The countries initiating such a club would agree on an Global Public Good

 The

\begin_layout Subsection
Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As already pointed out, in the choice of the retention rate parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 for the CORSIA+ mechanism there is a fundamental trade-off between achieving
 strong participation incentives and efficiency: Increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is good for increasing participation incentives but it comes at a welfare
 cost due to the decrease in the amount of money raised for GPGIs.
 Under the numerical assumptions detailed in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Estimates-of-Payoffs"

\end_inset

 it turns out that if 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is less than 39%, there is a unique Nash equilibrium, namely the profile
 where no player participates.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $r>39\%$
\end_inset

 there is a Nash equilibrium with full participation.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For ease of exposition we report in these motivating paragraphs results
 about what Nash equilibria exist.
 In section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Numerical-simulations"

\end_inset

 we will instead report the results obtained using an iterated best response
 algorithm, which allows us to evaluate the different mechanisms taking
 into account not only which Nash equilibria exist but also how difficult
 or easy it is to reach them.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Thus CORSIA+ can raise at most 61% of the tax revenue collected for the
 GPGI that it finances.
 The question therefore arises as to whether we could design alternative
 mechanisms that could raise a greater proportion of the tax revenue collected
 for GPGIs.
 The three proposals that we will define are partly motivated by this question
 and answer it in the affirmative.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The three proposals build on CORSIA+ by keeping the taxation obligation
 unchanged.
 However, in these alternative mechanisms the allocation obligation will
 be different.
 Participating countries get the option to decide on the GPGIs to which
 to allocate the money that they collect if they renounce on the right to
 retain any of the money for themselves.
 Reflecting this feature, we call the proposals

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast to CORSIA and CORSIA+, the treaty that would establish the MGF
 mechanisms would not select just a single GPGI to be financed through the
 mechanism.
 Instead, it would fix a set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 of GPGIs.
 The participating countries that give up the right to retain any of the
 tax revenue that they collect would be able to allocate the tax revenue
 that they collect to the GPGIs from 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 For the numerical simulations we will assume that the set

We arrive at these numbers using econometric estimates, data and several
 ad hoc assumptions.
 The methods are fully described in in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Effects-of-the"

\end_inset

.
 However, without going into much detail, we can already provide some explanatio
ns of these payoff estimates: Africa most benefits from Global Fund, since
 two thirds of the Global Fund's disbursements are made to African countries.
 China benefits substantially from all the GPGIs that reduce fossil fuel
 use: {CDM, ITER, Carbon Pricing Reward Fund}.
 The reasons for this are two-fold: Firstly through the reduced climate
 change and secondly through the decrease in the world market oil price
 that is caused by the decrease in fossil fuel demand.
 The latter effect is significant for China, since it imports most of its
 oil.
 The Carbon Pricing Reward Fund has a particular strong effect on the world
 market oil price, since it would mostly reduce oil use, in contrast to
 the CDM, which will mostly reduce coal use.
 The EU has a similar profile of payoffs to that from China, just larger
 in scale, given that the EU's economy is larger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The gains for the oil importers from reduced oil use and thus reduced world
 market oil prices come at the expense of oil exporters.
 This is why the Middle East negatively values money going to the three
 GPGIs that reduce fossil fuel use.
 It values particularly neagitvely money going to the Carbon Pricing, since
 this will disproportioately reduce demand for oil.
 Eurasia's payoff profile is qualitatively similar but much smaller in absolute
 value, since Eurasia is a much smaller player overall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
India and 'other Asia' both greatly benefit from any dollar going to the
 Carbon Pricing Reward Fund.
 This is in part because of the reduced climate damages and the reduced
 world market oil price that result from additional dollars going to the
 Carbon Pricing Reward Fund.
 In addition to that, the two players receive reward payments for low per
 capita emisssions and low fossil fuel subsidies from this GPGI and will
 thereby reap informational rents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Latin America benefits greatly from money going to the Forest Carbon Partnership
's Carbon Fund.
 This GPGI rewards countries for conserving tropical forests.
 Since conservation costs are countries' private information, they reap
 informational rents.
 Latin America, possessing a large fraction of the world's tropical forests,
 will reap a large part of these informational rents.
 Other Asia and Africa also value a dollar going the Forest Carbon Partnership's
 Carbon Fund, again mainly because of the informational rents that they
 get from it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To summarise: There appear to be three major effects determining the payoffs
 countries derive from additional money being provided to GPGIs:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1) effects due to the provision of the global public good
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2) redistributional effects due to induced price changes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3) informational rents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of these three effects turn out to be heterogenous across countries
 and as a result our payoff estimates (which take into account these three
 effects) exhibit substantial heterogeneity across countries.
 The two mechanism that we will now define are motivated by the hope that
 it might be possible to harness this heterogeity to generate participation
 incentives that arise as participants will be able to affect the allocation
 of money across GPGIs (in ways determined by the rules of the respective
 mechanisms).

Definition of Proposal 2: The Simple MGF mechanism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Simple MGF mechanism defines a club which any country can join or quit
 at any point in time.
 It could be started by any initial subset of countries who would select
 a set
\emph on
 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

\emph on
 GPGIs
\emph default

\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Throughout this article we take 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 to be exogenous.
 A fully worked-out proposal would need to specify rules for how the set
 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 could be modified over time.
 One posssible procedure could be the following: At any time participating
 countries could propose that a GPGI 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 be added to the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 or removed from the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 Then all participating countries would cast a vote.
 These votes could be weighted by population size.
 The GPGI 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 would be added to the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 iff the set of participants voting for the addition of the GPGI 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 comprises at least 50% of the weight of the set of all participants.
 Alternatively, the weight given to a country could be the sum of its population
 and some (country-independent) coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 times the aggregate voluntary contributions made by this country to all
 GPGIs in the 5 years preceding the vote.
 This would enhance countries' incentives to make voluntary contributions
 to GPGIs (including not only the GPGIs in 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 but any GPGI recognized as such by some independent commission).
 Thereby, countries could create new GPGIs through voluntary contributions,
 knowing that if they perform sufficiently well to attract wide support,
 it will be added to the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 and could receive future funding via the MGF mechanism.
 The coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 could be set so that at the time of the introduction of the MGF mechanism
 half of the aggregate weight of the worlds' countries would be due to the
 population and half of their aggregate weight would be due to the voluntary
 contributions.
\end_layout

 that would be considered as

To clarify the definition, we now restate it with some notation.
 For the purposes of this article we consider the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$

\begin_inset Formula $r$

 to be design choices for the mechanism.
 We take them to be fixed, i.e.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As introduced in the definition, we shall denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{k}$
\end_inset

 the flow of tax revenue that a participating country collects by taxing
 in accordance with the taxation obligation.
 Each participant has to choose the proportion 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

 that he wants to allocate to GPGIs.
 He also has to choose how to distribute the flow of money 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}M_{i}$
\end_inset

 to the GPGIs.
 In other words, he has to choose numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{s}^{i}\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{s\in S}q_{s}^{i}=1$

 and thereby he allocates the flow 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{s}^{i}p_{i}M_{i}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $s$

 These flows of moneys going to the GPGIs we will call the

 Of the money 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-p_{i})M_{i}$

The amount of money 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i\in Participants}(1-r)(1-p_{i})M_{i}$

 The definition of the mechanism stipulates that this money is to be allocated
 to the GPGIs in 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 in proportion to the aggregate direct allocations made to these GPGIs via
 the mechanism.
 In other words, from the money

 However, for the simulations in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Numerical-simulations"

\end_inset

 we will follow the common practice (see e.g.

 single player, as we have already stated in the description of the model
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 Depicted in the diagram below is a Nash equilibrium is strategy profile
 obtained in these simulations for the Simple MGF mechanism.
 The diagram describes how the final allocations to GPGIs are generated,
 given the players' strategy profile:

\begin_layout Standard
On the top of the diagram are displayed the design choices for the mechanism:
 The set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 of eligible GPGIs is here taken to be the 6 GPGIs described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 The retention rate parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is set to equal 0.4.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first line gives the design choices for the mechanism (i.e.
 the set of eligible GPGIs and the retention rate parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

).
 In the illustrative example represented by the diagram the set of eligible
 GPGIs has only three elements: CEPI, a Fund to purchase CDM offsets and
 the Forest Carbon Partnership's Carbon Fund.
 (For the actual simulations we will take 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 to be the set of the 6 GPGIs that we described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "2 GPGIs"

\end_inset

).
 Below these design choices we depict with the white rectangles the tax
 revenues that the participating players collect.
 These collected tax revenues only depend on which players are participating,
 since the taxation obligation is the same for all participants, irrespective
 of how they participate.
 Below that we have shown an example of a strategy profile.
 The players that have colored their rectangle are those that have chosen
 to participate with right to allocate.
 (We have arranged them to all be on the left to make the diagram more readable.)
 The colors correspond to the different GPGIs.
 Thus players 1 and 3 have chosen to give all to CEPI (in blue), player
 4 gives all to the Fund to purchase carbon offsets from the Clean Development
 Mechanism and players 2 and 5 give all to the Forest Carbon Partnership's
 Carbon Fund.
 Players 6 to 8 have chosen to participate without the right to allocate.
 A proportion 
\begin_inset Formula $r=\frac{1}{4}$
\end_inset

 of each of these players' rectangle is black, corresponding to the money
 that they can retain.
 The remaining part of their rectangles is made grey.
 These grey parts are collected and summed together below on the left.
 In the bottom left corner of the diagram we also collect and sum together
 the direct allocations for each GPGI.
 The final allocations are obtained through the computational step indicated
 by the arrow: It consists of converting the grey rectangle into colored
 parts in proportion to the direct allocations to the different GPGIs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To explore the consequence of the definition of the Simple MGF mechanism,
 consider for a moment what would happen if player 5 was to switch to participat
e without the right to allocate.
 In that case, he would be able to retain 
\begin_inset Formula $r*4=\frac{1}{4}*4=1$
\end_inset

 units of the tax revenue that he collects.
 However, the remaining 3 units of the tax revenue that he collects would
 now be split over the three GPGIs in propotion to the others' direct allocation
s.
 Moreover, the 10 grey units of revenue that come from those who already
 participate without the right to allocate will now be allocated in greater
 proportion to blue (i.e.
 CEPI) and green (i.e.
 CDM) and in lesser proportion to red (i.e.
 the Forest Carbon Partnership's carbon fund).
 If player 5 prefers red sufficiently strongly over blue and green, he will
 prefer to participate with right to allocate instead of participating without
 right to allocate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The question arises as to whether there exist modifications of the Simple
 MGF mechanism that would further enhance the incentives to participate
 with the right to allocate without complexifying the mechanism too much.
 The proposals 3 and 4 given below are attempts to achieve exactly that.
 They could also remedy an allocative inefficiency that might arise with
 the Simple MGF which we shall now briefly illustrate: Suppose there is
 a GPGI that no player ranks highest but that all players value highly.
 Then in the simple MGF mechanism this GPGI might not receive any money,
 even if the global marginal payoff from an additional dollar going to this
 GPGI is higher than that for all of the other GPGIs.

Definition of Proposal 3: The MGF mechanism with Proportional Matching Funds
 (PMFs)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The definition of the 'MGF mechanism with Proportional Matching Funds' is
 obtained by adding a further class of institutions to which those participating
 and choosing option 1 can allocate the tax revenue that they collect.
 In other words: The taxation obligations for participants are identical
 to those in the Simple MGF Mechanism and the allocation obligations are
 modified by expanding the set of institutions to which the participants
 can make direct allocations to also include 'Proportional Matching Funds'
 (PMFs)
\begin_inset Foot

 where it is sometimes also called 'Proportional Matching Fund' and sometimes

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 .
 Each country participating with the right to allocate can make direct allocatio
ns to the GPGIs (we will refer to the money allocated this ways as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

direct allocations
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 However, the country can also give money to the PMFs.
 A PMF is defined by the set of GPGIs that it 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

supports
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The money that the PMF receives is allocated to these GPGIs in proportion
 to the direct allocations made to them through the mechanism
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
i.e.
 other contributions such as voluntary contributions by states or foundations
 are not taken into account
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 As a result, the money in the PMFs enhances the effects that direct allocations
 to the GPGIs will have: The greater the direct allocations made to a GPGI
 
\begin_inset Formula $s\in S$
\end_inset

, the more money from the PMFs supporting 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 will we be allocated to 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

.
 Thus participation incentives for those strongly favoring one GPGI over
 the other GPGIs are increased.
 This strategic benefit suggests that for reaching wide participation it
 might be good to incentivise players to give to PMFs.
 In the definition given below this is achieved by adding the grey money
 (coming from the participants without the right to allocate) to the PMFs.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If players act with foresight, then they might want to give to PMFs even
 if the grey money was not given to the PMFs.
 However, we will assume in the simulations that players act myopically.

 Player 2 participates with the right to allocate and gives all the money
 he collects to the PMF for green and red (i.e.
 for the Fund to purchase carbon offset from the Clean Development Mechanism
 and for the Forest Carbon Partnership's Carbon Fund).
 Players 3,4 and 5 give all the tax revenue as direct allocations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the bottom left corner we collect all the direct allocations to the GPGIs.
 Above that we collect all the direct allocations to the PMFs.
 Above that, we gather all the money (in grey) that is collected by those
 who participate without the right to allocate and that is not retained
 by them.
 The arrows indicate the steps through which the final allocations are computed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the first step, the grey money is distributed to the PMFs in proportion
 to the direct allocations made to the PMFs.
 Graphically, this first step is represented by the first arrow.
 It consists of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

converting the grey money into PMF money, in proportion to the direct allocation
s made to the PMFs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 To state the rules for this first computation step formally and in full
 generality, let us denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 the aggregate amount of money that is not allocated (i.e.
 the amount in grey in the diagram).
 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $J\subset S$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $|J|\geq2$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $|J|$
\end_inset

 denotes the number of elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{J}$
\end_inset

 denote the aggregate direct allocations to the PMF for 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

.
 Then from 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 the following amount is given to the PMF for 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{|J|H_{J}}{\sum_{K\subset S:|K|\geq2}|K|H_{K}}G$
\end_inset

.
 The rationale motivating this rule is that the larger the set 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 of GPGIs that a player supports by giving to the 
\begin_inset Formula $HPMF_{J}$
\end_inset

, the more say he effectively leaves to the other participants.
 As a result, this can increase the incentives for the other players to
 join.
 It makes sense to reward the player for this, which is achieved through
 the simple weighting rule implemented by the formula 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{|J|H_{J}}{\sum_{K\subset S:|K|\geq2}|K|H_{K}}G$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second step (represented by the second arrow from the left), these
 amounts are added to the direct allocations to the PMFs.

 From a fully rational point of view, these aggregate final allocations
 should be all that matter.
 However, in the diagram as it is we emphasize the tracability of the money
 that is ensured in the mechanism by construction.
 This might actually be an attractive feature of the mechanism.
 It is in contrast to other mechanisms such as normalised gradient addition

 to the direct allocations made to these GPGIs.
 In particular each PMFs takes into account only the direct allocations

The iterated best response algorithm used
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start with an initial set of participants.
 The initial action profile consists of each of the initial participants
 allocating all the tax revenue that they collect (by complying with the
 taxation obligation) to their most preferred GPGI.
 A random player is chosen and he is given the opportunity to 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then we draw at each step a random player who is given the opportunity to
 adjust his strategy to a best response.
 There are two phases in the algorithm.
 In the first phase the initial participants discard the option of quitting
 the mechanism.
 In other words, when they are given the opportunity to adjust their strategy,
 they pick the best one amongst all those strategies that involve participating
 in the mechanism.
 The algorithm runs until no player wants to adjust their strategy any more.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The motivation for this first phase of the algorithm is that it seems a
 priori plausible that the players initiating the mechanism would have enough
 patience and foresight to not immediately quit the mechanism again.
 Instead, they are likely to at least wait and see whether other players
 want to join.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Then the second phase of the algorithm begins.
 From then onwards the initial participants no longer take the option of
 quitting off the table.
 The algorithm is then run until no player wants to adjust their strategy
 any more, which means that a Nash equilibrium is reached.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In all the simulations run thus far, the algorithm always reached a Nash
 equilibrium, as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $r\leq0.7$
\end_inset

.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $r>0.7$
\end_inset

, however, the algorithm sometimes did not reach a Nash equilibrium for
 the MGF mechanism with PMFs.
 Instead, it appeared to jump around indefinitely in the space of strategy
 profiles.

It is well known that iterated best response dynamics can fail to converge,
 even if there are pure strategy Nash equilibria (
\begin_inset CommandInset href

\end_inset

).
 This is indeed the case here: For 
\begin_inset Formula $r>0.7$
\end_inset

 one can show that if all players participate, then no player has an incentive
 to quit.
 Since the set of strategies that entail participation is convex, there
 must therefore exist at least one Nash equilibrium with full participation.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 For these cases I used a modifed version of the algorithm, where at each
 step a small positive parameter, called 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

, was slightly increased.
 At each step, again a random player was given the opportunity to adjust
 his strategy.
 However, it was assumed that the player would only actually adjust his
 strategy if the gain in payoffs exceeds 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

.
 The algorithm terminates when no player adjusts his strategy anymore.

 It always terminated, which means that a Nash equilibrium was always reached.
 In appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "part:A-more-detailed"

\end_inset

 we provide detailed summaries of the results.
 Here we shall focus on the average aggregate payoffs, which gives us an
 estimate of the expected global welfare that is generated.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that the payoffs in the game are normalised so as to be 0 for all players
 if none participates, so the aggregate payoffs do indeed give us the welfare
 gain relative to the status quo.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 As a normalisation, we set the tax revenue that would be collected if all
 players participate to 1.
 Thus in the following graph for example a value of 0.35 for the average
 aggregate payoffs means that the monetary value of the global welfare gains
 achieved through the mechanism equals 35% of the money that is collected
 as tax revenue if all players participate.
 In the graph we see that the main contribution to welfare comes from the
 money raised for GPGIs and only a small part comes from the mitigation
 benefits of reduced aviation emissions.
 To see this, one can look at the point where the retention rate parameter
 is 1.
 At that value, all players always participate but no money is raised for
 GPGIs.
 Thus the welfare is just equal to the climate change mitigation benefits
 from reduced aviation emissions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To evaluate the relative performance of the three mechanisms, consider first
 the case where if a mechanism is implemented, the 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is chosen at the value that maximises expected global welfare.
 As one can see in the graph, this optimal value of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is 0.45 for the MGF mechanism with All-Encompassing Proportional Matching
 Funds and 0.5 for CORSIA+ and for the Simple MGF mechanism.
 Under this assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is always chosen optimally, we get the following results:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Simple MGF mechanism achieves 13% more welfare than CORSIA+ and raises
 38% more money for GPGIs than CORSIA+.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MGF mechanism with AEPMFs achieves 29% more welfare than CORSIA+ and
 raises 47% more money for GPGIs than CORSIA+.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now let us look at what happens if we relax the assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is chosen exactly at the level that maximises global welfare.
 The graph suggests that this is likely to strenghten the conclusion that
 the MGF mechanism with AEPMFs performs best.
 Indeed, on the interval [0.35,0.55] the welfare achieved by the MGF mechanism
 with AEPMFs is almost as good as at the optimal retention rate parameter.
 CORSIA+ and the Simple MGF Mechanism are less robust to deviations of the
 retention rate parameter from its optimal value.

The overall design question is to choose the triplet 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,r,mechanism)$
\end_inset

 so as to maximise 
\begin_inset Formula $expected\,welfare(x,r,mechanism)$
\end_inset

.
 In this study we have investigated the comparative performance of the mechanism
s only for the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is small.
 Let us now consider how the mechanisms' performances would change as we
 increase 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 To rigorously answer this question we would need to fully specifiy a model
 of demand for air travel.
 For a small 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 we could make in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:The-tax-burden"

\end_inset

 the assumption that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{c_{k}}$
\end_inset

 corresponding to the costs that players bear due to increased taxes when
 joining do not depend on who else is already participating.
 For large 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 this might no longer be true.
 However, if we can neglect this effect, then we can see what would happen
 for higher 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 by running our simulations simply with increased values for the 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{c_{k}}$
\end_inset

.
 Indeed, the higher the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, the larger the deadweight loss from the perspective of the players due
 to the decreased flying of their citizens.
 In ongoing computations (available soon in an updated version of the article)
 we explore what happens if we multiply each 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{c_{k}}$
\end_inset

 by the same factor 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 The results so far indicate that for 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 ranging from 1 to 1.5 the the MGF mechanism with AEPMFs appears to continue
 to yield higher expected global welfare than CORSIA+ and the Simple MGF
 Mechanism for practically all values of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 Thus it appears that the MGF mechanism with AEPMFs robustly outperforms
 CORSIA+ and the Simple MGF mechanism.

 Let us denote by 'the eventual strategy profile reached under the algorithm'
 the last strategy profile that is recorded.
 This was always a Nash equilibrium for all of our simulations.
 The summary statistics displayed in the graphs are computed for the eventual
 strategy profiles over all the runs of the algorithm.
 For clarification, we provide the following descriptions of the computations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'maximal aggregate payoffs': For each run of the algorithm we take the eventual
 strategy profile, compute the corresponding payoffs and sum them together.
 Then we take the maximal value amongst all runs of the algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'average aggregate payoffs': For each run of the algorithm we take the eventual
 strategy profile, compute the corresponding payoffs and sum them together.
 Then we average over all runs of the algorithm.

\begin_layout Standard
'maximal aggregate money raised for GPGIs': For each run of the algorithm
 we take the eventual strategy profile, compute the corresponding payoffs
 and sum them together.
 Then we take the maximal value amongst all runs of the algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'average aggregate money raised for GPGIs': For each run of the algorithm
 we take the eventual strategy profile, compute the corresponding allocations
 to the GPGIs and sum them together.
 Then we average over all runs of the algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'proportion of money collected that is raised for GPGIs': For each run of
 the algorithm we take the eventual strategy profile, compute the corresponding
 allocations to the GPGIs and sum them together.
 Then we average over all runs of the algorithm, thus obtaining the average
 money raised for GPGIs.
 Moreover, for each run of the algorithm we take the eventual strategy profile,
 compute the corresponding aggregate tax revenue raised.
 Then we average over all runs of the algorithm, thus obtaining the average
 tax revenue collected.
 Finally, we compute the ratio of the average money raised for the GPGIs
 over the average tax revenue collected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'probability of reaching some Nash equilibrium with full participation':
 For each run of the algorithm, we record whether a Nash equilibrium is
 reached and if so, whether all players participate at this Nash equilibrium.
 Then we compute the proportion of runs for which a Nash equilibrium with
 full participation is reached.

Legitimacy and the risk of the mechanisms triggering trade wars
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout the analysis we have assumed away the possibility that countries
 that do not participate in the mechanisms might oppose it and retaliate
 against the participating countries.
 The EU's experience from 2012 that we outline in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:The-EU's-unilateral"

\end_inset

 shows that this danger needs to be taken very seriously.
 At the time many observers were concerned that the policy might trigger
 a 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "trade war"
target "https://www.dw.com/en/eu-emissions-policy-threatens-to-trigger-trade-war/a-16048424"

\end_inset

.
 For evaluating which mechanism should best be initiated, we need to take
 into account how each possible mechanism will affect the probability of
 a trade war.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seems plausible that the more a mechanism contributes to the welfare
 of non-participants, the less likely it is that they will oppose it.
 Firstly, this is because they have less material incentive to try to cause
 the mechanism to disappear.
 Secondly, the mechanism will presumably be more legitimate if the participating
 countries allocate most of the money to GPGIs rather than keeping it for
 themselves (as the EU did in 2012).
 The results from section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Proportion-of-money"

\end_inset

 suggest that the MGF mechanisms raise for GPGIs a greater proportion of
 the the tax revenue collected than CORSIA+ does.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is another reason why the MGF mechanisms could have more legitimacy
 than CORSIA+: Allowing participating countries to decide how to allocate
 to GPGIs the money that they collect as taxes would accomodate the demands
 of several countries including Brasil and China, who 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

\end_inset

 in the context of the CORSIA negotiations reject the idea that the list
 of eligible offset standards should be determined by the ICAO Council and
 prefer that States be allowed to apply their own offset standards.
 According to 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href

target "https://www.carbonbrief.org/corsia-un-plan-to-offset-growth-in-aviation-emissions-after-2020"

from the NGO Transport and Environment, who is an observer in the CORSIA
 negotiations: “The reason for China’s scepticism is that, as a point of
 principal, they don’t want to be told by a UN agency which offsets they
 have to use for their airlines.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These considerations thus all point in the direction of the MGF mechanisms
 having more legitimacy and incurring a lower probability of triggering
 a trade war.

Conclusion and discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have found in the numerical simulations that the MGF with AEPMFs can
 achieve 29% more welfare than CORSIA+.
 Moreover, the outperformance of the MGF mechanism with AEPMFs over CORSIA+
 and the Simple MGF mechanism appears to be robust to relaxing the assumption
 that the retention rate parameter is chosen optimally for each mechanism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One questionable assumption is that in the context of the mechanisms, the
 countries within each of the 12 regional blocks overcome their colletive
 action problems.
 This seems at first glance very implausible.
 However, in the context of the MGF mechanism with AEPMFs the gains from
 cooperation within each block might be particularly large, which presumably
 would make cooperation within each block more likely.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To see this, consider for example the gains from cooperation for African
 countries that arise endogenously at the Nash equilibria described in section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

: All African countries most benefit from money going to the Global Fund
 Against AIDS, TB and Malaria.
 By participating and giving money to this GPGI, African countries can cause
 not just the tax money that they collect to go to this GPGI but also additional
 money that comes from the PMF with Global Fund Against AIDS, TB and Malaria,
 CEPI and Forest Carbon Partnership's Carbon Fund, to which the Middle East
 allocates all its tax revenue.

Another questionable assumption is the absence of any foresight that has
 been implicit in the iterated best response algorithm that we have used.
 In all of the mechanisms that we have studied here the following holds:
 by participating, one decreases the incremental cost for the others to
 join.
 Thus foresight would weigh in favor of joining, since by doing so one can
 cause joining to be more attractive (and thus more likely) for others.
 Taking into account this effect would presumably improve the performance
 of all the three mechanisms to a similar extent.
 However, there is a further effect specific to the MGF with AEPMFs: By
 giving to an AEPMF for a set 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 of GPGIs, one can increase the incentives to join for others who strongly
 prefer some GPGI from 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 over the other GPGIs in 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

.
 This suggests that if one were to assume that players reason with foresight,
 then the performance of the MFG mechanism with AEPMFs would be improved
 by more than that of the other mechanisms.
 Future modelling work could investigate whether the conclusions of this
 line of informal reasoning do in fact hold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another important further research question is how the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 of eligible GPGIs will affect the performance of the MGF mechanisms.
 It is plausible that by adding further GPGIs which benefit different players,
 the performance of the MGF mechanisms will typically be improved.
 This would suggest that it might be good to add a global fund that would
 buy up fossil fuel deposits that are marginally profitable, as suggested
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Harstad (2012)"
target "https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/665405"

\end_inset

.
 This will benefit the countries possessing such deposits, as they will
 earn rents from the sale of the deposits.
 Another institution to add to the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 could be a fund that would reward countries for funding research on clean
 energy.
 Such a fund could build on the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

target "http://mission-innovation.net/"

\end_inset

 that was established in 2015.
 A better understanding of the effect of the set S on the performance of
 the mechanisms could be useful for informing the initial choice for the
 set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 when the mechanism is started.
 Moreover, it could also help in the design of mechanisms for updating the
 set

 Countries do not coordinate on ticket taxes.
 Moreover,by now it appears to be accepted that it is legal for each country

However, taxes on emissions are likely to have a lower

As mentioned before, we take into account two global effects that are caused
 by the reduction in oil consumption induced by a tax on aviation emissions:

 The elasticity of aviation demand is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{D}$

\begin_layout Standard
First let us compute the reduction in climate change damages.
 For this, consider a carbon tax equal to 1% of ticket prices.
 Such a tax will reduce aviation emissions by

 The total annual of emissions

 Whilst the normative arguments against pure time discounting are compelling,
 it seems more plausible to model countries as agents that use pure time

that the climate forcing effect of aviation emissions is 3 times that of
 its carbon content, due to the high altitudes at which they take place.
 Based on this, we assume that the social cost of aviation is 3 times that
 of its CO2 content contribution.
 Thus the total social cost of carbon from aviation is 
\begin_inset Formula $3\cdot\$36\cdot859\cdot10^{6}.$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
The carbon tax of 1% of ticket prices thus averts 
\begin_inset Formula $3\cdot\$36\cdot859\cdot10^{6}\cdot1\%\cdot\epsilon_{D}$

 of net climate damages due to aviation emissions.
 However, there is a rebound effect due to induced decrease in the price

 We must therefore multiply by

 Thus we obtain that per dollar of carbon tax collected the averted climate

 This estimate is an average of elasticities for price changes within and
 between regions closely corresponding to the regional blocks that are the
 players in our model.
 Thus these estimates do not take into account substitution to flights to
 other regions.
 We shall assume that 50% of the reduction in demand caused by an increase
 in the tax on aviation emissions within a region or between two regions
 leads to substitution to flights to other regions.
 Thus we need to multiply our estimate by 0.5, giving us 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{D}=0.5\cdot0.6=0.3$

 With this we obtain

Now let us compute the redistributive effect that happens due to the change

 This he could hypothetically do by making each agent a take-it-or-leave-it
 offer for doing the project, offering the project owner just enough money
 to make him indifferent between accepting the offer or not.
 The actual mechanism can now be viewed as a combination of this hypothetical
 contracting under perfect information and paying out gifts equal to the
 informational rents in the actual mechanism.
 We can view the first part in this combination as

The CDM has been criticised for having large rents (ref).
 However, increasingly, low cost abatement categories are covered under
 other mechanisms and are thus no longer eligible for new CDM projects.
 For example, HFCs are covered under the 2016 Kigali amendment to the Montreal
 protocol.
 Hence informational rents are getting smaller.
 This motivatess the following (admittedly ad hoc) assumption: We assume
 that in the actual CDM 50% of the money ends up being used for the purchasing
 the global public good of reducing emissions.
 This is illustrated in the following diagram:

We assume that the players (i.e.
 Africa, China, EU, Eurasia, India, Japan, Latin America, Middle East, Other
 high income countries, Russia, other Asia) internalise the rents accruing
 to the owners of projects on their territory.
 Moreover, we assume that the distribution of rents is proportional to the
 amount of CERs (certified emissions reductions) for CDM projects on the
 players' territories.
 We take the latest 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

\begin_layout Standard
Now let us turn to the effects of the actual emissions reductions.
 The players' payoffs are assumed to be affected in two ways.
 Firstly, the emissions reductions avert some climate change.
 We shall now make the ad hoc assumption that per dollar used to purchase
 emissions reductions 2.5 dollars of net global benefits arise
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This number is broadly consistent with our assumption that the social cost
 of carbon is $36 per ton of CO2.
 To see this, suppose that the marginal abatement cost of the projects funded
 via the CDM will be $10, in line with the marginal abatement cost curve
 shown above.
 This would imply that the benefit cost ratio would be 3.6.
 However,

73% of the potential 2013-2020 Certified Emissions Reduction (CER) supply
 have a low likelihood that emission reductions are additional and are not
 over-estimated
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, so so we should substantially revise our number downwards from 3.6.
 This makes 2 seem reasonable.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We assume that the distribution of these effects is proportional to the
 estimates from the RICE model (from Nordhaus 2010, also listed on page
 14 of 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

Actually, to compute the overall payoffs, we make a slight adjustment because

 According to

\end_inset

 projects are only eligible for receiving emissions reductions certificates
 if they can prove that they would not be profitable without the money from
 the sale of these certificates.
 One can show that if the marginal abatement cost curve is linear then the
 CDM does not change the incentives for the national government setting
 its subsidy for renewables.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The marginal abatement cost curve reported above already takes into account
 any national subsidies.
 The effective subsidy that project owners face is the sum of the national
 subsidy and the market price of the certificates for certified emissions
 reductions.
 We assume that the national subsidies are set individually optimally by
 each government.
 Therefore it is equal to the local externalities plus the global effects
 (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:The-global-effects"

\end_inset

) that the country internalises.
 From this it follows that an additional project that happens due to the
 CDM causes not only the global benefits but also causes costs equal to
 the subsidy in place in the country where the project takes place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In other words, since we assume that countries already set their national
 subsidies optimally from their perspectives, the global net benefit that
 an additional projects causes is computed by summing the benefits accruing
 to all the other countries but not to the country where the project takes
 place.
 Otherwise we would be double-counting.

The second effect arising from emissions reductions is a redistribution
 from net oil exporters to net oil importers.
 From 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 we know what this effect would be if all the emissions reductions were
 realised through reductions in oil consumption.
 Based on the data provided in http://www.cdmpipeline.org/cdm-projects-type.htm,
 I make the preliminary guess that the proportion of the CDM's emissions
 reductions that are through reduced oil demand is 0.2.

 Whenever additional money is added to ITER (and assuming that the rules
 for access to the technology are not changed), the expected value of these
 rents is increased.
 Specifically, we will assume that the expected value of rents is increased
 by $0.5 for every $1 added to ITER.
 Analogously to our analysis of the CDM, we can think of a dollar reaching
 ITER to be split: $0.5 are given out as rents and the remaining $0.5 are

 We shall consider the following version of this kind of proposal
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Cramton and Stoft's proposal is to use an additive reward payment function,
 instead of the multiplicative that we consider here.
 The reasons why we consider the multiplicative function here are that it
 leads to more of the informational rents accruing to low income countries
 and stronger incentives for them to reduce fossil fuel subsidies and to
 tax carbon.
 Assuming higher marginal utility of money in these countries, shifting
 informational rents to them is beneficial.
 Moreover, in these countries the removal of fossil fuel subsidies and the
 introduction of carbon taxes are very progressive in their distributional
 effects (

\begin_layout Standard
We will assume that the Carbon Pricing Reward Fund uses the multiplicative
 mechansim.
 Given that the policies that the Carbon Pricing Reward would incentivise
 are very cost-effective, the question arises as to why such a mechanism
 does not already exist.
 One explanation could be that a large proportion of the money would end
 up accruing as informational rents.
 Based on this, we make the ad hoc assumption that per dollar given to the
 Carbon Pricing Reward Fund 0.8 dollar end up accruing as informational rents,
 as illustrated in the diagram:

As long as the budget of the Carbon Pricing Reward Fund is small, the informatio

\end_inset

 that we obtain by substituting in the status quo values of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 This is a consequence of the envelope theorem.
 To compute the status quo consumption based emissions we use

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Concerning the 0.2 dollars that do not accrue as informational rents, we
 make the ad hoc assumption that the multiplicative mechanism is 1.5 times
 as efficient at reducing emissions as the CDM.
 To compute the amount of oil rent redistribution, we proceed as follows:
 First we compute what this effect would be if all the emissions reductions
 achieved were through decreased oil consumption, using that in this case
 the ratio of the oil rent redistribution to the climate benefit would have
 to be the same as we obtained in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:The-global-effects"

\end_inset

.
 However, we need to adjust this estimate, since part of the emissions reduction
s that the Carbon Pricing Reward Fund would induce could be in the form
 of reductions in coal and gas consumption.
 We make the ad hoc assumption that we have to multiply our estimate by
 0.75 in order to get the true value of the oil rent redistribution effect.
  Unfortnuately, the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

Effects per dollar given to the Forest Carbon Partnership's Carbon Fund
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Forest Carbon Partnership rewards countries with tropical forests for
 conserving them.
 An elaborate methodology has been developed through which reference levels
 of deforestation are determined.
 Reward payments are made for reductions in deforestation below the reference
 levels.
 This is in contrast to the Carbon Pricing Reward Fund proposals, where
 reference levels are not differentiated across countries.
 This suggests that we should assume that the Forest Carbon Partnership's
 Carbon Fund will generate less informational rents than the Carbon Pricing
 Reward Fund and motivates our ad hoc assumption that per dollar given to
 this GPGI 0.5 dollar accrue as informational rents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, we can think of an additional dollar as doing a combination two things:
 Firstly, paying out informational rents and secondly, purchasing the global
 public good (in this case reducing emission due to tropical deforestation)
 by compensating the agents in the mechanism (in this case national and
 local governments) for the costs incurred to increase the provision of
 the global public good.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Analogously to the case of the CDM, we assume that the status quo each country
 chooses its level of forest conservation selfishly optimal, taking into
 account that it internalises a part of the global effects of climate change
 mitigation.
 Thus the net global benefits of an emissions reduction taking place in
 a given country is equal to the sum of the global effects accruing to all
 the other countries.

 The number 2.1 is chosen so as to ensure that the assumptions are favorable

\begin_layout Standard
There is also a potentially important redistributive general equilibrium
 effect that we need to take into account: Some of the forest conservation
 measures that will be taken in response to the incentive payments provided
 by the Forest Carbon Partnership's Carbon Fund will entail reducing the
 production of commodities such as palm oil, pulp, paper, timber and soy
 beans that are produced by the countries with tropical forests.
 As a result, the world market price of these commodities increases, which
 benefits the sellers of these commodities.

 point to a countervailing effect that also needs to be taken into account:
 Higher prices for the commodities driving deforestation makes illeal logging
 more profitable, thereby making enforcement of conservation more costly.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The flip side of this is of course that the buyers of these commodities
 loose out.
 We make the ad hoc assumption that per dollar used to purchase emissions
 reductions, 0.5 dollars of benefits accrue to the sellers.
 We assume that consumption of these commodities is proportional to GDP
 and that the production is proportional to the tropical forest cover.
 We leave it for future work to generate proper estimates using data on
 all the commodities that drive deforestation.

 future novel pathogens might cause global pandemics.

 since people buy them to signal via these goods' prices.
 Current tax rates on luxury goods appear to be a result of a coordination
 problem between countries: China lowered its taxes on luxury goods in 2016
 so as to reduce the profit margins for people who buy luxury goods abroad,
 evade customs in China and resell them there.
 These high profit margins for smugglers only exist because when buying
 goods abroad, people can get VAT refunds when they return to their home
 country.

All this suggests that through additional taxes on luxury goods money could
 be raised with a very low associated global tax burden.
 A design task is how to adapt the taxation obligation in the MGF mechanisms
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Definition-of-Proposal 1"

\end_inset

) to the case of luxury goods.
 One possibility could be as follows: Each participant would have to tax
 the sale of all luxury goods on their territory at a rate 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover, each participant would have to tax all exports of luxury goods
 to non-participating countries at the rate 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, he would have to tax all exports of intermediate goods used
 to produce luxury goods in non-participating countries (e.g.
 raw diamonds for jewelry production) at some rate 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, which could be calibrated so as to achieve that in non-participating countries
 similar overall taxes weigh on luxury goods.
 The allocation obligation could be kept identical to the one in the original
 MGF mechnanisms (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Definition-of-Proposal 1"

\end_inset

).

\begin_layout Standard
This proposal would violate the destination principle for indirect taxes
 and as such might be inconsistent with existing WTO agreements (see

\end_inset

).
 However, if most of the tax revenu collected via the mechanism is raised
 for Global Public Good Institutions, it is plausible that the mechanism
 would have enough legitimacy so as to allow an exemption to the destination
 principle for it.
