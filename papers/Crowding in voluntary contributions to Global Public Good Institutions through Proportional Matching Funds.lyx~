financed via voluntary contributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far we have been implicitly assuming that the voluntary contributions
 that countries make to the GPGIs are unaffected by the contributions made
 via the MCT mechanism.
 We will later try to better understand how these voluntary contributions
 might change endogenously in response to changes in financing from other
 sources such as the MCT mechanism.
 In preparation for that task we will study the question of how voluntary
 contributions to a given GPGI will endogenously change in response to a
 change in an exogenous additional funding for that GPGI.
 This question is also relevant in its own right, for example for assessing
 existing proposals to use global resources to finance particular GPGIs,
 as we will discuss later

\begin_layout Standard
The set of all countries is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $I$

 There is a private good and a set 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 of donor independent GPGIs.
 Each country 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in I$
\end_inset

 chooses its consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

 of the private good and its vector 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 of voluntary (monetary) contributions to the GPGIs (where 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{ik}\geq0$
\end_inset

 denotes country 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

's contribution to GPGI 
\begin_inset Formula $k$

 Country 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

's utility is given by: 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}(c_{i},Q)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 denotes the vector of aggregate (monetary) contributions.
 Here the aggregate contribution to the GPGI 
\begin_inset Formula $k\in K$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{k}=\sum_{i\in I}q_{ik}$
\end_inset

.
 Country 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

's budget constraint is that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}+\sum_{k\in K}q_{ik}\leq y_{i}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

 is exogenous.
 Each country takes the other countries' choices as given and chooses 
\begin_inset Formula $(c_{i},\{q_{ik},k\in K\})$
\end_inset

 so as to maximise 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}(c_{i},Q)$

 in our terminology) Suppose that at the status quo the GPGIs are entirely
 financed through voluntary contributions.
 Suppose that each country's payoff from a GPGI is a concave function of
 the money available for that GPGI.
 Consider a reform consisting of imposing lump sum taxes on a set of countries
 each of which voluntarily contributes some money to some GPGI, such that
 no country is taxed more than its status quo aggregate contribution to
 GPGIs.
 Suppose all the money raised through these lump sum taxes is allocated
 to the GPGIs, with none of the transfers exceeding the total funding at
 the status quo for any GPGI.
 Then the reform has no effect.

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Country 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

 faces the problem to maximise 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}(c_{i},Q)$

\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}+\sum_{k\in K}(Q_{k}-(\sum_{j\neq i}q_{jk}+G_{k}))\leq y_{i}-L_{i}$

with the further constraint that 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{k}\geq G_{k}+\sum_{j\neq i}q_{jk}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can rewrite this problem by eliminating 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}(y_{i}-L_{i}-\sum_{k\in K}(Q_{k}-(\sum_{j\neq i}q_{jk}+G_{k})),Q)$

Consider the situation without the transfers, i.e.
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{i}=0\forall i$
\end_inset

.
 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $(\tilde{q_{ik}})_{i\in I,k\in K}$
\end_inset

 is a Nash equilibrium.
 Now consider a global mechanism that consists of contributing 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{k}$
\end_inset

 to the GPGI 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, financed by the lump sum taxes 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{i}\leq y_{i}-\tilde{c_{i}}$
\end_inset

 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{k}\leq\sum_{i}\tilde{q_{ik}}$

 Now consider any 
\begin_inset Formula $(\hat{q_{ik}})_{i\in I,k\in K}$

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{q_{ik}}\geq0$
\end_inset

 from

 Then by the asssumed convexity of the payoff from 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 for country 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, there would also be a profitable deviation for player

\begin_layout Proposition
(Almost a neutrality theorem)

\end_inset

 Suppose that at the status quo the GPGIs are entirely financed through
 voluntary contributions.
 Consider a reform that raises an amount 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\ensuremath{F\leq\sum_{i\in I,k\in K}\tilde{q_{ik}}}}$
\end_inset

 of money from non-contributors (i.e.
 from countrie that do not contribute to any of the GPGIs) and and allocates
 this money to the GPGIs in such a way that for each of the GPGI the transfer
 does not exceed the funding available at the status quo.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 denote the resulting allocation and 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 denote the set of contributors to global public goods at 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 Then there exists a set of lump sum transfers 
\begin_inset Formula $\{t_{j}\geq0,j\in J\}$
\end_inset

 distributing the money 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 to the contributors, i.e.
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j\in J}t_{j}=F$
\end_inset

 such that the resulting allocation is 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
proof
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The intervention 'raising money for the GPGIs from non-contributors in a
 lump sum way' can be written as a sum of 'raising money for the GPGIs from
 contributors in a lump sum way' + 'redistributing money from the non-contributo
rs to the contributors'.
 By proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "prop:(restatement-of-the"

\end_inset

 the first of these interventions satisfies neutrality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us analyse the MCT mechanism at taxation rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\ensuremath{x^{\#}}}$
\end_inset

.
 To do that, consider starting at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 and increasing the rate to 
\begin_inset Formula $dx>0$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 be the proportion of money raised from countries that do not contribute
 to any GPGIs.
 Proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "(Almost-a-neutrality"

\end_inset

 predicts that this is equivalent to some lump sum transfer from the countries
 that at the status quo do not make any voluntary contributions to GPGIs
 to countries that at the status quo do make voluntary contributions to
 some GPGIs.
 Also, it predicts that it does not matter to which contributor the money
 is given.
 Supposing that this transfer does not change the proportion 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 of money that the contributors give to GPGIs, this would mean a dollar
 raised via the MCT for GPGIs would only result in 
\begin_inset Formula $pz$
\end_inset

 dollars of actual increase in funding for GPGIs.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 is smaller than 1% for all countries, this shows that the conclusion is
 almost as pessimistic as in a situation in which the neutrality theorem
 applies.

A model for the game of voluntary contributions to a Global Public Good

\begin_layout Subsubsection
A model for the case of Direct Procurement GPGIs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 denotes the set of all countries.
 Each country 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in I$
\end_inset

 chooses the voluntary contribution 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 to the GPGI in question.
 The GPGI then takes an action 
\begin_inset Formula $z(Q)$
\end_inset

.
 Here we are using that by the definition of Direct Procurement GPGIs, the
 action 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 of the GPGI depends only on the total money 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 at its disposal.
 Country 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

's payoff is: 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{i}=u_{i}(z(Q))-h_{i}(q_{i})$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Microfoundations for the payoff function

\begin_layout Standard
The benefit 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}(x_{i},x_{-i})$
\end_inset

 that the player 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 internalises can incorporate pure altruism.
 In fact, this seems necessary to explain Norway's and Sweden's high contributio
ns to global public goods.
 Given that these countries only have populations of 5 million and 10 million,
 respectively, the partial internalisation of the benefits of global public
 goods can hardly account for these countries' contributions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The function 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{i}(q_{i})$
\end_inset

 might write as: 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{i}(q_{i})=c_{i}(q_{i})-s_{i}(q_{i})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}(q_{i})$
\end_inset

 could represent the net expected political cost.
 This could on the one hand include both the opportunity cost of public
 funds and the risk that domestic political forces will discredit the government
 for some constituencies that would accuse it to not act in the national
 interest.
 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 could include the benefit of earning the support of citizens in favor of
 altruistic action as well as the diplomatic recognition and reputation
 internationally.
 It is then plausible that we have 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}'>0,c_{i}''>0,s_{i}'>0,s_{i}''<0$
\end_inset

, which would imply that 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{i}''(q_{i})>0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the litterature modelling the voluntary contributions of states (ref)
 it is assumed that in their decision how much to voluntarily contribute
 to GPGIs countries only consider the benefit of marginal funding to the
 GPGI and the opportunity costs of funds.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Implications-for-the opportunity costs"

\end_inset

 we will see that this would imply that the 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{i}$
\end_inset

 is almost perfectly flat on the relevant range.
 This is why the following proposition will be of interest:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "flat costs"

\end_inset

Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{i}(q_{i})=q_{i}\forall i$
\end_inset

.
 Then almost surely only one player contributes money to the GPGI in the
 first stage of the game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
Consider the marginal benefits 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial Q}$
\end_inset

 of additional money provided the GPGI in question.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{*}(i)$
\end_inset

 be the set of funding levels at which country 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is indifferent between contributing a bit more or a bit less.
 Almost surely, each of the 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{*}(i)$
\end_inset

 is finite.
 Hence for any 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j\in I$
\end_inset

 almost surely 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{*}(i)\cap S^{*}(j)=\emptyset$
\end_inset

.
 But if 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 are to both contribute at the Nash equilibrium, this can only happen at
 a 
\begin_inset Formula $Q\in S^{*}(i)\cap S^{*}(j)$

We now give an illustrative computation that makes the following basic point:
 Each government's contribution to each GPGI is a very small fraction of
 its GPD.
 Therefore, the marginal opportunity costs of each government's contributions
 are almost perfectly constant in the relevant range.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i}(y)$
\end_inset

 the utility that government

 gets, given that its GDP is 
\begin_inset Formula $y$

 Suppose that

\end_inset

 consists only of the opportunity cost of the money 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 contributed (as is the case in the models in which the Neutrality Theorem
 holds (see Sandler (ref)).
 Then we must have 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{i}(q_{i})=V_{i}(GDP_{i}-q_{i})$
\end_inset

, since giving away the amount 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 is by equivalent to reducing the GDP by 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 if we assume that the government can levy lump sum taxes.

We see that for all countries and all global institutions for which we have
 given the data here, the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{q_{i}}{GDP_{i}-q_{i}}$
\end_inset

 is very close to 0.
 This will still be true for all the other global institutions and for other
 specifications of how a government's payoff depends on its available money.
 In other words: If we assume that countries' costs of contributions is
 determined by their opportunity costs of the money, then we obtain that
 a constant marginal cost function would be an extremely good approximation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have seen 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 that this would imply that we should expect there to be only one contributing
 country for each GPGI.
 However, for the examples we have seen (CEPI, GAVI, Global Fund for AIDS,
 TB and Malaria, Forest Carbon Partnership) there are always several contributin
g countries.
 Thus we can conclude that the function 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{i}(q_{i})$
\end_inset

 must contain more components than just the opportunity costs of funds.

We shall analyse a donor-indpendent GPGI.
 We shall use the utility specification 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{i}=u_{i}(M)-h_{i}(q_{i})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is the total amount of money at the disposal of the GPGI.
 We will consider the case where

\end_inset

 is the sum of an external amount 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 and the aggregate voluntary contributions 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$

 This specification contains as a special case the model for the Direct

\begin_inset Formula $U_{i}=u_{i}(z)-h_{i}(q_{i})$

 that the GPGI will take will be determined by its available money,

 for analyzing Reward Payment based GPGIs, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{i}=u_{i}(x_{i}(M),x_{-i}(M))-h_{i}(q_{i})+g_{i}(R_{i})$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}$

 is determined by

\end_inset

 Consider a GPGI that is financed by an exogenous donation of 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 and by voluntary contributions by governments that are determined as a
 Nash equilibrium given 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

.
 Denoting the elasticities of marginal benefits and marginal costs by 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{u_{i}'}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{h_{i}'}$
\end_inset

, respectively, and supposing that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i\in Contributors}\frac{\epsilon_{u_{i}'}}{\epsilon_{h_{i}'}}\frac{q_{i}}{Q+F}\leq1$
\end_inset

, we obtain: 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dQ}{dF}=\frac{\sum_{i\in Contributors}\frac{\epsilon_{u_{i}'}}{\epsilon_{h_{i}'}}\frac{q_{i}}{Q+F}}{1-\sum_{i\in Contributors}\frac{\epsilon_{u_{i}'}}{\epsilon_{h_{i}'}}\frac{q_{i}}{Q+F}}$

\begin_layout Proposition

\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
The government of country 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 has payoff 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{i}=u_{i}(Q+F)-h_{i}(q_{i})$
\end_inset

.
 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in Contributors$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 is determined by the FOC, which is: 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dU_{i}}{dq_{i}}=u_{i}'(Q+F)-h_{i}'(q_{i})=0$
\end_inset

.
 Differentiating this FOC with respect to F yields:
\begin_inset Formula $(\frac{dQ}{dF}+1)u_{i}''(Q+F)-\frac{dq_{i}}{dF}h_{i}''(q_{i})=0$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
Now using again the FOC we can rewrite this as: 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dq_{i}}{dF}=(\frac{dQ}{dF}+1)\frac{u_{i}''(Q+F)}{u_{i}'(Q+F)}\frac{h_{i}'(q_{i})}{h_{i}''(q_{i})}=(\frac{dQ}{dF}+1)\frac{u_{i}''(Q+F)(Q+F)}{u_{i}'(Q+F)}\frac{h_{i}'(q_{i})}{h_{i}''(q_{i})q_{i}}\frac{q_{i}}{Q+F}=(\frac{dQ}{dF}+1)\frac{\epsilon_{u_{i}'}}{\epsilon_{h_{i}'}}\frac{q_{i}}{Q+F}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
Summing over all contributors yields: 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dQ}{dF}=(\frac{dQ}{dF}+1)\sum_{i\in Contributors}\frac{\epsilon_{u_{i}'}}{\epsilon_{h_{i}'}}\frac{q_{i}}{Q+F}$
\end_inset

.
 From this we deduce: 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dQ}{dF}=\frac{\sum_{i\in Contributors}\frac{\epsilon_{u_{i}'}}{\epsilon_{h_{i}'}}\frac{q_{i}}{Q+F}}{1-\sum_{i\in Contributors}\frac{\epsilon_{u_{i}'}}{\epsilon_{h_{i}'}}\frac{q_{i}}{Q+F}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Separator plain
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us consider the formula 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dQ}{dF}=\frac{\sum_{i\in Contributors}\frac{\epsilon_{u_{i}'}}{\epsilon_{h_{i}'}}\frac{q_{i}}{Q+F}}{1-\sum_{i\in Contributors}\frac{\epsilon_{u_{i}'}}{\epsilon_{h_{i}'}}\frac{q_{i}}{Q+F}}$
\end_inset

.
 First consider the case where all the marginal benefits are concave, i.e.
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{u_{i}'}\leq0\forall i\in Contributors$
\end_inset

 and where all the marginal cost curves are convex, i.e.
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{h_{i}'}\geq\text{0}\forall i\in Contributors$
\end_inset

.
 In this case the smaller the elasticities of the marginal costs are, the
 more crowding out there is.
 Moreover if all the elasticities of the marginal costs are very close to
 0 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dQ}{dF}$
\end_inset

 is close to 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

, meaning that there is close to full crowding out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now consider the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{u_{i}'}=0\forall i\in Contributors$
\end_inset

.
 then we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dQ}{dF}=0$
\end_inset

.
 In other words: If the curves for the marginal benefit as a function of
 the available money to the global institution are flat, then the 'naive
 view' that evaluates the impact of additional funding contributed by a
 philantropist or raised through international taxes without taking into
 account the endogenous change in voluntary constributions is correct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, consider the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i\in Contributors}\frac{\epsilon_{u_{i}'}}{\epsilon_{h_{i}'}}\frac{q_{i}}{Q+F}\in(0,1)$
\end_inset

.
 (This can happen if some of the contributors' marginal benefit curves are
 locally convex around the equilibrium.) In this case we see that there is
 actually 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

crowding in
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dQ}{dF}>0$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i\in Contributors}\frac{\epsilon_{u_{i}'}}{\epsilon_{h_{i}'}}\frac{q_{i}}{Q+F}>1$
\end_inset

 there will even be a discontinuous jump in the equilibrium.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To see why this happens, we note that from the second order conditions we
 can only establish: 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}''(Q+F)\leq h_{i}''(q_{i})$
\end_inset

, which using the FOC can be rewritten as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{u_{i}''(Q+F)}{u_{i}'(Q+F)}\leq\frac{h_{i}''(q_{i})}{h_{i}'(q_{i})}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\frac{u_{i}''(Q+F)}{u_{i}'(Q+F)}}{\frac{h_{i}''(q_{i})}{h_{i}'(q_{i})}}\leq1$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\epsilon_{u_{i}'}}{\epsilon_{h_{i}'}}\frac{q_{i}}{Q+F}\leq1$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is not sufficient to ensure that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i\in Contributors}\frac{\epsilon_{u_{i}'}}{\epsilon_{h_{i}'}}\frac{q_{i}}{Q+F}\leq1$
\end_inset

 it is suggested that: “royalties” obtained from natural resource extraction
 beyond territorial limits, such as from the oceans beyond territorial limits,
 Antarctica or outer space, could be tapped for international development
 cooperation.
 As global resources lie outside national jurisdictions, any licensing and
 payment of royalties would have to involve an international authority that
 was recognized as the responsible agent for managing the specific commons.
 While fishing in international waters and other activities in the “commons”
 might be licensed in this way, only revenues from mining the seabed has
 thus far been seen as a source of international public revenue.

 was obtained through long computations using Mathematica.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since by definition 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i\in Contributors_{a}}\frac{q_{ai}}{Q_{a}}=1$
\end_inset

 , we can deduce from the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{-\epsilon_{u_{i}'}^{a}}{\epsilon_{h_{i,a}'}}\geq-1\forall i\in Contributors_{a}$
\end_inset

 that the denominator, 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{1}\text{+\text{\ensuremath{\sum_{i\in Contributors_{a}(0)}\frac{q_{i,a}}{Q_{a}}\frac{-\epsilon_{u_{i}'}^{a}}{\epsilon_{h_{i,a}'}}}}}$
\end_inset

, is positive.
 Let us from now on focus on the generic case in which this is strictly
 positive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now consider the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\sum_{b\neq a}\frac{Q_{b}}{Q-Q_{a}}\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial Q_{b}}}{\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial Q_{a}}}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in Contributor_{a}$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{b\neq a}\frac{Q_{b}}{Q-Q_{a}}=1,$
\end_inset

 the numerator, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{b\neq a}\frac{Q_{b}}{Q-Q_{a}}\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial Q_{b}}$
\end_inset

, is a weighted average of the marginal utility that country 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 gets from additional financing for the other GPGIs (i.e.
 excluding 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

), weighted in proportion to the financing that these receive.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in Contributor_{a}$
\end_inset

, it is plausible that we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\sum_{b\neq a}\frac{Q_{b}}{Q-Q_{a}}\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial Q_{b}}}{\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial Q_{a}}}\leq1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus we see that the sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dQ_{a}}{dF}|_{F=0}$
\end_inset

 is determined by two forces.
 Firstly, there is the positive term 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{Q-Q_{a}}{Q}(\text{\ensuremath{1}}-\frac{\sum_{b\neq a}\frac{Q_{b}}{Q-Q_{a}}\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial Q_{b}}}{\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial Q_{a}}})$
\end_inset

, which arises from the fact that the marginal increase of 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 starting from 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 increases country 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

's incentive to voluntarily contribute, since by doing so it can move money
 to its preferred GPGI, 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, shifting it away from the other GPGIs.
 The size of this effect is proportional to the proportion of money going
 to the other GPGIs, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{Q-Q_{a}}{Q}$
\end_inset

.
 Secondly, there is the term 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{u_{i}'}^{a}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{u_{i}'}^{a}>0$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 if there are increasing marginal benefits accruing to country 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 from money going to the GPGI 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, then we obtain the conclusion that 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{u_{i}'}^{a}+\frac{Q-Q_{a}}{Q}(\text{\ensuremath{1}}-\frac{\sum_{b\neq a}\frac{Q_{b}}{Q-Q_{a}}\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial Q_{b}}}{\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial Q_{a}}})>0$
\end_inset

.
 Thus in this case there is always 'crowding in' of voluntary contributions
 to the GPGI 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 from country 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 We also see that the size of this effect increases in 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{\epsilon_{h_{i,a}'}}$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover, there is no theoretical bound on how strong the crowding-in can
 be, as we will prove in corollary below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now consider the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{u_{i}'}^{a}<0$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 when there are decreasing marginal benefits accruing to country 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 from money going to the GPGI 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{u_{i}'}^{a}$
\end_inset

 is sufficiently negative then there will be crowding out of contributions
 from country 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 for the GPGI 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 Specifically the condition for there to be crowding out is 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\ensuremath{\frac{-\epsilon_{u_{i}'}^{a}}{\frac{Q-Q_{a}}{Q}}>1}}-\frac{\sum_{b\neq a}\frac{Q_{b}}{Q-Q_{a}}\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial Q_{b}}}{\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial Q_{a}}}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\forall i\in Contributors_{a}$
\end_inset

.
 For the limit we get:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{\epsilon_{u_{ai}}^{a}\rightarrow-\infty}\text{\text{\frac{dQ_{a}}{dF}}}=-1$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Separator plain
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This makes sense: If for some country the marginal benefit drops off all
 of a sudden exactly at the current level of financing for the GPGI 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, then the aggregate contribution to the GPGI 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 cannot increase until country 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

's contribution has been fully crowded out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
\begin_inset Formula $\sup_{set\,of\,all\,models}min\{\frac{dQ_{a}}{dF}|_{F=0}:a\in J\}=\infty$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
proof: Suppose we have any model with corresponding Nash equilibrium such
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{u_{i}'}^{a}+\frac{Q-Q_{a}}{Q}(\text{\ensuremath{1}}-\frac{\sum_{b\neq a}\frac{Q_{b}}{Q-Q_{a}}\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial Q_{b}}}{\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial Q_{a}}})>0\forall a\in J\forall i\in Contributor_{a}$
\end_inset

 at this Nash equilibrium.
 Let us keep the model to first order unchanged around the Nash equilibrium
 but multiply all the elasticities by the same factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda<1$
\end_inset

.
 Then the second order conditions for the best responses are still satisfied.
 Moreover, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dQ_{a}}{dF}|_{F=0}$
\end_inset

 increases, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{Q-Q_{a}}{Q}(\text{\ensuremath{1}}-\frac{\sum_{b\neq a}\frac{Q_{b}}{Q-Q_{a}}\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial Q_{b}}}{\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial Q_{a}}})>0$
\end_inset

 and we can make this increase arbitrarily large if we choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 sufficiently close to 
\begin_inset Formula $0$

The GPGI selection problem for the PMF mechanism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose there is a set of governments who are considering setting up a PMF.
 Specifically, suppose that they are ready to voluntarily contribute money
 to this PMF and that there is a chance that by doing so they could acquire
 recognition for moral leadership that would allow them to get all countries
 to consider the proposal of allocating the revenues generated from the
 deep sea resources to the PMF instead of paying them out to countries.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the decision problem of the set of people who have the opportunity
 to give advice to these governments that are considering setting up a PMF.
 Which set of GPGIs should the advisors recommend to be included in the
 PMF? There are least three important considerations to be taken into account:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1) The global benefit, evaluated from an impartial perspective, that is
 generated per additional dollar available for the GPGI
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2) The crowding out/ crowding in of voluntary contributions to the GPGIs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3) The distribution of payoffs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider first the global benefit, evaluated from an impartial perspective.
 There are strong reasons to think that reducing existential risks could
 be of enourmous value in expectation (
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "www.existential-risk.org/concept.pdf"

\end_inset

).
 Global pandemics might be one of the largest existential risks.
 Advancing research aimed at improving the capacity for the world to quickly
 develop vaccines when faced with new pathogens could be an effective way
 to reduce this risk.
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28806130"

\end_inset

 This would imply that CEPI might be one of the most valuable GPGIs.
 This consideration would weigh strongly in favor of including CEPI in the
 PMF mechanism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to estimate the global benefit that the PMF generates, it is potentiall
y important to take into account the amount of crowding out/crowding in
 that takes place.
 Switching from a regime (that currently appears to be envisaged) where
 the revenue from the seabed resources from the high sea are paid out to
 countries to a regime where this money is instead paid out to some GPGI
 is equivalent to implementing lump sum taxes on countries and giving the
 money raised to the GPGI.
 However, as we indicated in the discussion following 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "(Almost-a-neutrality"

\end_inset

, as far as the effect on voluntary contributions is concerned, this is
 approximately equivalent to considering the money as coming from 'outside',
 i.e.
 as being raised from non-contributors, given how small contributions for
 GPGIs are relative to GDP for any given country (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Implications-for-the opportunity costs"

\end_inset

).
 Thus proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "PMF crowding in and out"

\end_inset

 seems applicable.
 In particular, the disucssion following 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "PMF crowding in and out"

\end_inset

 applies.
 One general conclusion that we obtained from the formula 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dQ_{a}}{dF}|_{F=0}=\frac{\text{\ensuremath{\sum_{i\in Contributors_{a}(0)}\frac{q_{i,a}}{Q}\left(\epsilon_{u_{i}'}^{a}+\frac{Q-Q_{a}}{Q}(\text{\ensuremath{1}}-\frac{\sum_{b\neq a}\frac{Q_{b}}{Q-Q_{a}}\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial Q_{b}}}{\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial Q_{a}}})\right)\frac{1}{\epsilon_{h_{i,a}'}}}}}{\text{1}\text{+\text{\ensuremath{\sum_{i\in Contributors_{a}(0)}\frac{q_{i,a}}{Q_{a}}\frac{-\epsilon_{u_{i}'}^{a}}{\epsilon_{h_{i,a}'}}}}}}$
\end_inset

 is that the more concave the benefits of the GPGI as a function of its
 available funding, (i.e.
 the smaller the
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{u_{i}'}^{a}$
\end_inset

), the worse.
 Thus other things equal, it is better to include GPGIs that do not have
 strongly diminishing marginal benefits.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another consequence of this formula is that it is good if the GPGIs included
 in the PMG are such that the countries contributing voluntarily strongly
 prefer one of them over the other, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\ensuremath{1}}-\frac{\sum_{b\neq a}\frac{Q_{b}}{Q-Q_{a}}\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial Q_{b}}}{\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial Q_{a}}}$
\end_inset

 is large.
 This might be an important argument for including GPGIs with strongly dispersed
 payoffs such as a RES-Fund (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "RES-Fund IRENA"

\end_inset

) and/or a Global Fund to reward countries as a function of carbon emissions
 and carbon taxes (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "exa:A-Proposed-Global carbon tax incentive"

\end_inset

) in addition to GPGIs dedicated to preventing global pandemics, such as
 CEPI, even if the latter score better under criterion 1).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thirdly, the distribution of payoffs might affect the probability that the
 PMF will be adopted for using the revenues from deep sea resources.
 It is likely important that all countries can be confident that channelling
 the global revenues to the PMF will end up leading to an equilibirum giving
 them a higher payoff than under the counterfactual (which appears to entail
 the paying out the money generated from global resources to all countries).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The GPGI selection problem for the MCT mechanism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose there is a set of governments who are interested in the MCT proposal.
 Consider the decision problem of the set of people who have the opportunity
 to give advice to these governments.
 Which GPGIs should they recommend as eligible for the MCT? There are least
 three important considerations to be taken into account:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1) The global benefit, evaluated from an impartial perspective, that is
 generated per additional dollar available for the GPGI
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2) The crowding out/ crowding in of voluntary contributions to the GPGIs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3) The incentives for governments to participate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4) The incentives for governments to choose the status with the right to
 influence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Concerning 1), the discussion provided in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:The-GPGI-selection PMF"

\end_inset

 applies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to assess 2), the question arises as to how one should model the
 introduction of the MCT.
 One approach to modelling this would be as a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium
 of a two stage game, where in the first stage countries play the game induced
 by the MCT mechanism and in the second stage countries play the voluntary
 contribution game.
 In this case, we should dampen our optimism about the potential of the
 MCT, to the extent that there is crowding out.
 This is because in the first stage of the game countries will anticipate
 the crowding out and thus the benefit that they ascribe to money being
 directed via the MCT mechanism to a GPGI.
 To put it more precisely: Suppose the benefit for country 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 per money directed to GPGI 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{i}^{k}$
\end_inset

.
 Then the relevant payoff in the first stage of the game is actually 
\begin_inset Formula $(1+\frac{dQ_{k}}{dF})\theta_{i}^{k}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, in this model crowding out would not only lessen the impact of the
 money raised via the MCT mechanism for the GPGIs, it would also make it
 less likely that the MCT mechanism would have full (or even any) participation.
 From the formula 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dQ}{dF}=\frac{\sum_{i\in Contributors}\frac{\epsilon_{u_{i}'}}{\epsilon_{h_{i}'}}\frac{q_{i}}{Q+F}}{1-\sum_{i\in Contributors}\frac{\epsilon_{u_{i}'}}{\epsilon_{h_{i}'}}\frac{q_{i}}{Q+F}}$
\end_inset

 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Crowding-out for exogenous donation to a given GPGI"

\end_inset

) we see that this again provides a rationale for selecting GPGIs whose
 benefits are not too concave, i.e.
 for which the 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{u_{i}'}$
\end_inset

 are not too small.
 Under the alternative modelling approach, where the players simultaneously
 choose their status and allocation in the MCT and their voluntary contributions
 there would similarly be crowding out, but this would not directly diminish
 the participation incentives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now let us turn to 3) and 4).
 3) is clearly, since participation incentives have to be sufficient, ideally
 to end up inducing full participation.
 4) is important since the more players choose the status with the right
 to influence, the more money will be raised for GPGIs, which is valuable
 not only because of its direct benefit but also because this confers more
 legitimacy to the mechanism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As far as the participation incentives are concerned, it is good for the
 set of eligible GPGIs to be such that the players stronlgy prefer some
 GPGI over the others.
 In fact, this will be good for both 3) and 4), since it will increase the
 players' gains from participating with the right to influence.
 Again, this might be an important argument for including GPGIs with strongly
 dispersed payoffs such as a RES-Fund (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "RES-Fund IRENA"

\end_inset

) and/or a Global Fund to reward countries as a function of carbon emissions
 and carbon taxes (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 CEPI, even if the latter score better under criterion 1).

How to learn from past data about crowding in and crowding out?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One approach would be to study the few cases where countries have introduced
 taxes to finance global institutions, for example the case of France in
 2006.
 However, the situation for the countries who introduced the solidarity
 levy on air tickets might have been quite different: Since few countries
 participated in the mechanism, introducing the tax and transferring the
 money to UNITAID was very similar to making a voluntary contribution from
 the general budget.
 The governments could thus get diplomatic credit for an act of altruism
 in a similar way to making a voluntary contribution.
 Moreover, domestic actors could accuse the government of giving away money
 without pursuing national interest in just the same way as is the case
 for voluntary contributions.
 As we have already pointed out, this would not be the case for a Nash equilibri
um with full participation under the MCT mechanism.
 In this case the government would still need to make voluntary contributions
 to GPGIs in order to get diplomatic recognition for its altruism.
 Moverover, domestic actors could only accuse it for being too generous
 on the basis of the amount of the voluntary contribution.
 The same arguments apply to the case of contributions to GPGIs coming from
 international seabed resources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If this line of reasoning is correct, then we cannot rely on the past example
 of taxes financing GPGIs to learn about crowding in and crowding out.
 Instead, a more promising approach might be to try to estimate the elasticities
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{u_{i}'}^{a}$

\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{h_{i}'}^{a}$
